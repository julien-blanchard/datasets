            "raw_text": "Recently, I overheard a conversation between two women in which one of them was giving out about her husband. During the big freeze last December, the woman had asked her husband, a farmer, if their children could invite some schoolfriends over to go sledding on the hills in the farm, which were covered in snow. Her husband advised against the invitation in case one of the friends became injured and he ended up with an insurance claim against him. This is how mad the situation around insurance claims in Ireland has become. What seems like a perfectly innocent situation triggered concerns about a possible insurance claim. Recent years have seen business owners and voluntary organisations being hit with tens of thousands of euro in insurance claims for what often are minor injuries in the most innocent of settings, often where the claimant is largely responsible for the incident. Large payouts may be justified when a significant injury is involved and where a business is negligent or reckless. However, all too often, the payouts are awarded against a business without establishing their negligence or recklessness. The cost of business insurance has gone through the roof in recent years. Worries about insurance costs have kept owners awake at night. Others have simply had enough and shut up shop altogether. This is all still happening despite a pledge made by the Government two years ago \u2013 through its Action Plan for Insurance Reform \u2013 to bring down the cost of business insurance. The plan contained 66 measures which, it was hoped, would lead to greater competition in the insurance market and lower premiums for customers and businesses. So far, that plan has for the most part delivered for motor insurance consumers, but has been less effective in driving down business insurance claims costs. The Government is always keen to point out how it believes the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) \u2013 and personal injuries guidelines introduced in Spring 2021 \u2013 have significantly reduced awards and brought down the cost of motor insurance. However, only 15 per cent of motor insurance injury claims are settled through the PIAB, according to recent figures from the National Claims Information Database (NCID). Twice as many motor insurance injury claims are settled through the courts and 35 per cent are settled directly with insurers. The insurance that puts most financial strain on businesses is public liability (PL) and employer liability (EL) cover. PL insurance covers the business in the event that a member of the public becomes injured on the premises; EL provides cover in the event that an employee is injured while working for the company. In my experience as a practitioner in business insurance, very few EL or PL claims go through PIAB. For most people, the first \u2013 and only \u2013 port of call for such claims is a solicitor. Fewer than half of the awards from the EL claims that actually go through PIAB are accepted by claimants \u2013 while only six in 10 PL PIAB awards are accepted, according to a recent D\u00e1il question on the issue. Many EL and PL claims end up in court. A good chunk of those should never see the light of day. Injuries have been feigned and exaggerated. Businesses have often been left footing the bill for an injury that arose as a result of a claimant\u2019s poor judgment and decision-making \u2013 rather than any failure on the part of business. Recently, a D\u00e1il question was put to then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe asking him to explain why the Action Plan for Insurance Reform had been so successful in reducing motor insurance premiums while premiums for business insurance, such as EL and PL, continue to rise. He acknowledged that from 2009 to 2020, the average cost of EL claims increased by 68 per cent overall, while the average cost of PL claims increased by 40 per cent. \u201cCombined with this, we can also see from NCID data that the EL and PL sector has been largely loss-making since 2015, and thus many firms have had to increase premiums to cover these losses,\u201d said the minister. [\u00a0 High insurance costs may affect Ireland\u2019s ability to attract international artists, says promoter \u00a0] There are up to 16 providers competing in the motor insurance market, but there is far less competition in the business liability insurance sector and, given the losses incurred , this is hardly surprising. Ireland is a small country, so rather than quoting for all business sectors, insurers typically specialise in one or a number of areas to ensure that they generate enough experience in a sector to correctly calculate the risks involved. So while we typically have just two to three insurers quoting for a business at renewal, there is scope, assuming a reduction in the volume of claims and the average payout, to have five to six competing in each business sector. Business insurance risks vary considerably so we\u2019ll never have 16 providers competing as we have in motor insurance. Changes in the pipeline around duty of care rules \u2013 which aim to balance a property owner or business\u2019s duty of care with the personal responsibility of members of the public \u2013 should encourage more players into the business liability insurance sector. Currently those rules are too skewed in favour of the customer \u2013 and too open to abuse as a result. Insurers need to play their part in keeping premiums down by acknowledging the significant impact of inflation. Insurers typically calculate premiums based on the company\u2019s turnover and wages. Take a builder who built 20 house extensions last year and plans to build another 20 this year. Unfortunately, he now needs to pay his staff higher wages to retain them and he also needs to charge the customer more as raw material and staff costs have risen. As turnover and wages go up, so too does the premium as the insurer charges more \u2013 but the risks haven\u2019t increased one iota. Insurers needs to adjust their rates to allow for inflation. Ireland needs to adopt a zero-tolerance stance to monster business insurance costs and claims. It\u2019s not just businesses that lose out to high insurance costs and claims. So too do their staff, customers, and the wider economy. And even simple childhood pleasures like sledding in the snow. Jonathan Hehir is chief executive of CFM Group",

            "raw_text": "A woman who attempted a fraud with her brother by falsely claiming that an elderly motorist reversed into their vehicle has received a fully suspended sentence. Dublin Circuit Criminal Court heard that Suzanne Maguire (37) claimed she had spilled hot coffee over herself as a result of the fictitious impact and Edward Maguire (46) later attempted to lodge a claim with an insurance company, despite not being in the car at the time. The alleged road traffic accident happened in a car park outside a convenience store on Glasnevin Avenue, in Dublin. Suzanne Maguire, of Sillogue, Ballymun, and Edward Maguire of Cabra Park, Dublin 7, both pleaded guilty to attempting to induce Axa Insurance to pay out on the foot of a false claim with the intention of making a gain for themselves or causing a loss to another on September 22nd, 2017. Suzanne Maguire has 59 previous convictions, including 33 for theft and others for public order, deception, handling, obstruction, failing to appear and assaults. Edward Maguire has 24 previous convictions including breach of a barring order, road traffic, larceny, trespass, theft and threats to kill. At a previous sentencing hearing in April 2021, Judge Pauline Codd sentenced Edward Maguire to two years imprisonment, which she suspended in full on strict conditions including that he engage with the Probation Service for two years. Passing sentence on Tuesday, Judge Codd said it was \u201cquite clear\u201d Suzanne Maguire instigated the offending conduct and that her brother went along with it. Judge Codd said the most significant aggravating factor was that the target of this offence was an elderly person. She said she accepted it was an opportunistic offence, but said it was \u201ca nasty offence\u201d. She said the accused woman has taken \u201cvery significant steps\u201d to address her addiction and to come off drugs. She noted the accused is currently pregnant. Judge Codd sentenced Suzanne Maguire to three years imprisonment, but suspended the sentence in its entirety on strict conditions, including that she follow all directions of the Probation Service for two years. \u2018Plastic bollard\u2019 At a previous sentencing hearing, Garda Sean Burke told Antonia Boyle BL, prosecuting, that Suzanne Maguire was sitting in her brother\u2019s car when an elderly man hit a plastic bollard while he was reversing his vehicle out of a parking space. Gda Burke said Maguire got out of the car and approached the driver claiming that he had hit her brother\u2019s vehicle and caused damage. She also claimed that she spilled hot coffee over herself as a result of the impact and took a photograph of the man\u2019s car and his insurance disc. Edward Maguire later followed through on the allegation by attempting to lodge a claim with Axa Insurance. He also claimed that he was in the vehicle at the time and had pain in his shoulder, while his sister had blisters on her leg from the coffee having been spilled. The insurance company investigated the claim and secured CCTV footage proving that there was no impact between the cars and that Edward Maguire was not in the vehicle at the time. Axa did not process the claim, garda\u00ed\u00ad were alerted and the two were arrested. Rebecca Smith BL, defending Suzanne Maguire, said her client, a mother-of-four, grew up in a \u201cchaotic background\u201d which had a traumatic effect on her. Ms Smith said her client was taken out of the house at a young age to live with her older sister, but moved back into the family home as a 12-year-old girl when her father left. Counsel said her client had a very bad drug addiction, but she has since tackled many of her issues and has stopped abusing cocaine and heroin. \u201cShe still has trouble with cannabis,\u201d Ms Smith said. \u201cThis is the best she has come in her whole life in terms of addressing her addiction,\u201d counsel submitted, before she added that her client has not come to garda attention since the offence. \u201cShe has indicated that she would like to prove to the court that she has changed. Her priority is her drug addiction, her children and leaving her criminality behind,\u201d Ms Smith said.",

            "raw_text": "A husband and wife falsely tried to claim they had been injured in a car accident after the husband reversed into an off-duty garda driving a van, a Dublin court has heard. Rene Cifra (34) was only 15 minutes into his new job as a food delivery man in May 2019 when he missed the house he was delivering to and decided to reverse down Griffith Avenue, Dublin Circuit Criminal Court heard on Tuesday. Cifra collided with a Mercedes van which was being driven by an off-duty garda and ended up writing off his car. Cifra went on to claim to Liberty insurance that his wife had also been in the car at the time and they were both injured in the collision. His wife, Olga Cifrova (31) also made the same claim, Detective Garda Dominic McGrath told the court. Both Cifra and Cifrova, of Watermint Court, Royal Canal Park, Ashtown, pleaded guilty to making a false and misleading personal injuries claim on dates between August 2019 and January 2020. Neither have previous convictions and they are the parents of two young children, the court heard. Det Gda McGrath told Fiona McGowan BL, prosecuting, that Cifra reversed into the van on Griffith Avenue on May 27th, 2019, when he was trying to find a house to deliver food. The van was being driven by an off-duty garda who had borrowed t it from a colleague. Both men exchanged insurance details, with Cifra admitting at the scene that he had been at fault, the court heard. A few months later, his insurance company \u2013 Allianz \u2013 paid a sum of \u20ac650 to the van owner. Cifra was annoyed to hear the insurance company had made the pay-out without contacting him and viewed it as being found \"guilty\" in the accident, defence counsel said. As a result, he filed a false claim of injury against the van owner's insurance company, Liberty Insurance. Cifra did not have good English and had already told garda\u00ed\u00ad his wife was present at the scene of the accident, in order to have a witness there. The couple, who are originally from Slovakia, went to a solicitor where they both filed false personal injury claims. They also visited a doctor in Cavan with the intention of getting medical documentation. The details of their fabricated injuries were not outlined in court. As soon as the van owner was informed of the claim, he gave his insurance company the details of the accident, including the fact that Cifra\u2019s wife was not in the car at the time. Garda\u00ed called to the couple\u2019s home and Cifrova was arrested. When questioned by garda\u00ed\u00ad, Cifrova pretended she had been present at the accident and drew a sketch of what happened, which was soon found to be totally different to what had actually occurred. Cifra attended the garda\u00ed\u00ad later by appointment and admitted to fabricating the personal injury claim. Cifrova later admitted the same. Deirdre Flannery BL, defending Cifrova, said this was a case that \u201cwould never have made it to the steps of the Four Courts, never mind the PIAB (Personal Injuries Assessment Board).\u201d She said Cifrova later described it as \u201cthe biggest mistake of her life\u201d. The court heard that Cifra has been living in Ireland since 2008, when he met Cifrova who moved here at the age of 15. Both of their children were born here. They have both worked a number of minimum wage jobs. Donncha Craddock BL defending Cifra, said his client had just started a new job as a food delivery driver when the collision occurred. He lost his job and wrote off the family car in the incident. He is currently working part-time as a cleaner. Judge Karen O\u2019Connor ordered a probation report into the couple and adjourned the matter for sentencing on July 27th.",

            "raw_text": "One of the country\u2019s largest waste management firms, Thorntons Recycling, last year received a \u20ac12.1 million insurance payout arising from \u201ca serious fire\u201d at the group\u2019s Killeen Rd facility in Dublin 12. In January 2021, the firm\u2019s Ballyfermot facility went on fire and the facility reopened in November last year \u201cfollowing significant investment\u201d. New accounts for Padraig Thornton Waste Disposal Ltd and subsidiaries show that the group last year received \u20ac6.8 million in insurance compensation from the damage caused by the fire and an additional \u20ac5.3 million from a business interruption claim arising from the fire. The insurance payout contributed to the group pretax profits increasing by 56 per cent to \u20ac8.7 million last year. This followed revenues increasing by 7 per cent from \u20ac86.32 million to \u20ac92.28 million. The family owned business serves 70,000 customers each day and the \u20ac12.1 million in exceptional income from the two insurance claims was offset by the firm writing off the \u20ac4.1 million book value of the Killeen Rd land and buildings which increased the group\u2019s administrative expenses from \u20ac9.95 million to \u20ac15.4 million. The directors, Shane and Paul Thornton state that the new Killeen Rd plant \u201cis more efficient and sustainable than the previous facility and should improve overall recycling and recovery rates of materials processed\u201d. In their report, the Thorntons state that normalised pretax profits of \u20ac6 million was achieved for the year. The directors state that the business was able to achieve the seven per cent sales growth despite the impact of Covid-19 and the Killeen Rd fire. They state that this was mainly achieved through organic growth in its domestic and skip hire business and the acquisition of the Rathcoole based Skip Trans business in 2021. The pretax profit last year takes account of combined non-cash depreciation and amortisation charges of \u20ac7.27 million. Numbers employed by the group last year increased by 43 from 459 to 502 as staff costs increased from \u20ac21.93 million to \u20ac23.4 million. Pay to key management personnel last year increased from \u20ac566,121 to \u20ac604,345. The business recorded post tax profits of \u20ac7.44 million after paying corporation tax of \u20ac1.27 million. On the business\u2019s future developments, the directors state \u201cwe will continue to focus on growing market share through organic growth and acquisition.\u201d At the end of December last, the group had shareholder funds of \u20ac50.79 million that included accumulated profits of \u20ac45.28m.",

            "title": "Aircraft leasing firms kick off insurance claims for planes stuck in Russia",
            "author": "Thu Mar",
            "date": "2022-03-24",
            "raw_text": "Russia\u2019s move to transfer almost 800 foreign-owned jets to its own aircraft register amid foreign sanctions has triggered a wave of insurance claims from leasing firms whose fleets have effectively been commandeered. Lessors will assert that registering the planes in Russia when they\u2019re already on the books in other territories amounts to a qualifying event for claims, including under their war-risk policies, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be named as the proceedings are confidential. While some notices had already gone out, the effort to re-register planes in Russia has given the process impetus, the people said. Fitch Ratings puts the insured residual value of aircraft held by Russia following its invasion of Ukraine at $13 billion (\u20ac11.8 billion), though with aggregate loss limits claims may be limited to $10 billion. That would still be by far the largest sum in the history of aviation insurance, it said. In a separate report, Moody's Investors Service estimates up to $11 billion in losses. Irish lessors such as AerCap are particularly affected. A number of the initial claims were made under so-called hull loss policies that kick in if a whole plane is written off, as if it had crashed or disappeared. The prospect of having a stronger case offers some encouragement to a jet-leasing sector that has the green light to repossess aircraft under international sanctions but no realistic way of doing so. At the same time, the value of the jets is likely to tumble as a moratorium on shipments of approved spare parts leads airlines to resort to non-standard maintenance. Ownership Insurers could still haggle over the size of payouts since Russia continues to recognise lessors\u2019 ownership of the jets, according to the people. \u201cIt is unclear at this stage whether insurers will have to pay all these claims,\u201d Moody\u2019s said, citing a number of variables including the prospect of negotiations with airlines. Most aviation policies are underwritten through the Lloyd\u2019s of London market, with up to 40 per cent of exposure ceded to reinsurers, according to Fitch. Some specialist Lloyd\u2019s carriers could see \u201cmodest capital depletion\u201d where losses combine with other large claims, it said. Analysts at Berenberg identified players with potential exposure including Atrium Underwriters, Axa XL, Beazley, Chubb, Fidelis, Liberty Specialty Markets and Tokio Marine Kiln, according to a Reinsurance News report. There may also be disagreements over whether coverage automatically expired once sanctions were imposed, or was cancelled before the actual claims event, Fitch said. Even with the maximum possible payout most insurers and reinsurers would suffer only a hit to earnings, rather than capital depletion, it said. Lloyd's of London disputed the estimates from Moodys and Fitch, saying that while the war in Ukraine represents a major claim, insurers' liability was limited to around 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the asset value of jets stuck in Russia. \"So it's a much smaller element than many people would think,\" Lloyd's chief executive John Neal said in a Bloomberg TV interview Thursday. \"It will take a little bit of time to work out that loss, and then determine whether there is a loss at all in some instances.\" Russian proposal Leasing firms seeking to repossess planes have until March 28th to cancel contracts under European Union sanctions and broader banking prohibitions. Dublin-based AerCap Holdings, the world's biggest leasing firm, had 142 aircraft placed with Russia as of March 10th, according to consulting firm IBA. SMBC Aviation Capital had 35. Lessors with asset-backed securities exposed to Russia include Carlyle Aviation Management, Air Lease Corp, according to Kroll Bond Ratings. It remains unclear how many leased planes remain in Russia. Russia this week offered to provide compensation for the seized planes, including their outright purchase, though Moscow says lessors have been unwilling to negotiate on the matter. That\u2019s most likely because any financial accord with airlines would appear to present a clear breach of sanctions. Russia moved the aircraft to its register after the Republic and Bermuda, where most are listed, suspended their airworthiness certificates, citing a lack of clarity over maintenance regimes. But the planes are still registered in those jurisdictions, and under rules established by Article 18 of the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, they can\u2019t be listed under more than one authority at a time. \u2013 Bloomberg",

            "author": "Dominic Coyle",
            "date": "2024-04-26",
            "raw_text": "It has taken two and a half years but this week the Government finally got around to unveiling the details of its  low cost loan scheme  to incentivise homeowners to undertake energy retrofits. The scheme was first flagged at the publication of the  Climate Action Plan  and its associated  National Retrofit Plan  in November 2021. Details of the loan scheme were initially promised to be revealed in 2022 by the Minister responsible,  \u00c9amon Ryan . That deadline, and at least four successive ones, were all missed. Meanwhile, the pace of domestic retrofits to the B2 Building Energy Rating standard has been lagging well behind the pace required to meet the 2030 target of 500,000 home retrofits, set by the Government. Part of the problem has been a shortage of contractors to carry out the works but homeowners have also been put off by the potential cost. Back in 2021, Ryan\u2019s Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications estimated that retrofitting a house to a BER B2 level and installing a heat pump would cost between \u20ac14,000 and \u20ac66,000. As with all such things, those costs have inevitably risen since. Rising interest rates over that time mean the first offering under the \u20ac500 million Home Energy Upgrade Loan Scheme announced on Wednesday is coming in above the 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent promised. . PTSB has organised funding for the scheme with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the State bank whose prime focus is organising affordable funding solutions for Irelands small and medium-sized businesses, at rates varying from 3.55 per cent and 4.55 per cent. The lower the amount borrowed, the higher the interest rate. We\u2019re assured that other banks will follow PTSB shortly in offering similar low cost borrowing for these SEAI-approved energy retrofits, including AIB, Bank of Ireland and Avant Money, as well as seven credit unions. Each will make their own call on interest rates but it is likely that some will be offering even more attractive rates than PTSB. So how does it work and who can avail of these loans? And crucially, how do they go about it? Who qualifies? Who qualifies? It is open to any homeowner, including landlords who can apply in respect of no more than three properties. Companies are excluded, as is anyone applying on behalf of another person. Also excluded are properties used as holiday homes or for short-term Airbnb-type lettings in the previous 12 months. If part of the property has been used for commercial purposes in the past year, it will also be excluded. In all three cases, you\u2019ll need to undertake that you do not carry out any of those activities for at least a year after you secure the funding. You need to be resident in Ireland. The property you are applying for financial support to retrofit must be located in the Republic and you must prove your ownership of the property by providing its MPRN (electricity meter point reference number). An applicant cannot be either insolvent or bankrupt. You must also be in receipt of an SEAI grant for the works you are undertaking. That means you have to fulfil the criteria of one of the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme or the Better Energy Homes Scheme. Details can be found on the  grants page  of the SEAI website. Most grants apply only to homes built before 2011. Houses seeking heat pumps can be much more recently built. The SEAI site says it can take up to six weeks to finalise grant funding. It could be longer. How do I apply? How do I apply? Your first step is to arrange an energy assessment of your property. This must be carried out by one of the  one-stop shops  approved by the  Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) , an SEAI-approved  energy partner  or a registered  community project coordinator  and you will pay for it regardless of whether it leads to a successful loan application or not. If it finds that the proposed upgrades will improve your home\u2019s energy efficiency by 20 per cent or more, you qualify. The approved person you have engaged will manage the process from start to finish and carry out all the works. You then access one of the loan providers through the  SBCI website . How much can I get? How much can I get? You can borrow anywhere between \u20ac5,000 and \u20ac75,000 per property repayable over anything from one to 10 years. An individual applicant can apply for retrofitting on up to three properties with a \u20ac225,000 cap on individual borrowing. The money is unsecured which means, unlike a mortgage, the lender has no security, such as your home, against the loan. The SBCI also says that people can avail of more than one loan as long as the total does not exceed the \u20ac75,000 per property / \u20ac225,000 per person cap. When can I access the funds? When can I access the funds? The loans are accessible now and will be available until the end of 2026, unless the \u20ac500 million allocated for it is fully subscribed for before then. The first provider, PTSB, has access to \u20ac100 million of this funding. What sorts of energy upgrades are covered? What sorts of energy upgrades are covered? That depends whether you go the  Better Energy Homes Scheme  route or the  National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme  via a one-stop shop. Both cover things like wall, roof and attic insulation. That includes insulation of external walls, internal walls or cavity block walls. Heat pumps and heating controls are also covered as is solar water heating. But if you are looking at new windows, floor insulation, ventilation or installing solar panels, these are only available on the latter scheme. On the flip side, using the former route does allow you to upgrade on a step-by-step basis as funding or other factors allow. Under the one-stop shop route, the whole upgrade is done at the one time. Are there any specific rules attached to the funds? Are there any specific rules attached to the funds? Yes, you need to spend at least three-quarters of the loan on the energy upgrades. The balance can be spent on putting the house right again \u2013 painting and so on \u2013 after the works have been completed. Also, you cannot apply for loans for work that has already been completed, so get the grant funding and the paperwork done before you engage anyone to do the work. How competitive are these rates? How competitive are these rates? They are certainly competitive compared to PTSB\u2019s current home improvement loan rate of 7.9 per cent, or its personal loan rates which range from 10 per cent to 13.4 per cent. PTSB\u2019s home improvement rates are not the most competitive but the new low cost loan rate still compares favourably to AIB\u2019s current green loan offer of 6.25 per cent, An Post\u2019s 6.7 per cent or Avant\u2019s 6.9 per cent. What those banks offer under the new low cost loan scheme remains to be seen. Why are banks offering low rates for these products? Why are banks offering low rates for these products? The Government is subsidising the interest rates by two percentage points to allow the bank offerings to be more attractive for homeowners. The banks also have the comfort of a European Investment Bank guarantee which ensures they will recover 80 per cent of their money even if the borrower defaults. However, if you do not repay the money or use it for purposes other than those agreed, the preferential loan rate will be dropped after three years and you may be charged a higher rate of interest. In those circumstances, the bank can also demand immediate repayment of the full loan. What\u2019s in it for me? What\u2019s in it for me? All sorts of things. First, you have the peace of mind of knowing that you are making your house as energy efficient as possible. Apart from doing your bit to ease our climate change headache, you should also benefit from lower energy bills and, depending on whether you go solar or not, even the change to make some money by selling power back into the grid. Another practical benefit of improving your home\u2019s building energy rating is that it should allow you to switch your mortgage to a green loan rate which are the most competitive in the market, saving you further money on your monthly bills. So everybody\u2019s happy? So everybody\u2019s happy? If my network is anything to go by, a lot of people have put off undertaking significant energy upgrades pending the release of details about these low cost loans, so I would expect it will trigger an acceleration of applications for retrofits. Commenting on the announcement, Friends of the Earth described it as \u201cwelcome\u201d, including its inclusion of small private sector landlords. \u201cThis loan scheme gives households agency to retrofit in stages and at a pace that works for them, taking some pressure off to undertake a more costly deep retrofit,\u201d said Clare O\u2019Connor, the charity\u2019s energy policy officer. But she said there was scope to better target families on lower incomes \u201cby following the lead of the Dutch government, which offers a zero-interest retrofit loan for households with an income under \u20ac60,000\u2033. It also wants the Warmer Homes Scheme, which offers free energy upgrades to people on certain welfare payments and living in properties built before 2006, to be expanded to include HAP tenants and those on disability allowance.

            "raw_text": "Innovu, the private equity-backed insurance brokers group, has acquired Goggin Insurance Brokers in Munster for an undisclosed amount, as consolidation of this fragmented part of financial services continues apace. The deal will see Darragh Goggin, chief executive of the 41-year-old company being bought, become shareholder and director of the enlarged Innovu group. Goggin Insurance has offices in Newcastle West, Co Limerick; and Listowel, Co Kerry. The Innovo name stems from the vehicle that private equity firm MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland used to take a stake of about 75 per cent in Sheridan Insurances in early 2019. It went on within months to buy Wexford Insurances, one of the State's leading equestrian insurance brokerages. The latest deal, following a pause in 2020 amid Covid-19, will bring total annual gross written premiums to about \u20ac42 million and Innovu's staff of insurance professionals to 120. The group, led by chief executive Ronan Foley, has previously stated that it wants to grow over the long-term to become a business with \u20ac250 million-\u20ac300 million of premiums. MML remains the majority shareholder after the latest deal. \"We intend to invest further to support the overall business to help it accelerate its growth plans, with further acquisitions planned in the near term,\" said Shane Cooke, an investment director at MML. Industry consolidation There are about 1,200 general insurance and financial brokers in the Republic, mainly family-owned businesses. However, the sector has seen a raft of deals in recent times, fuelled by strong valuations being achieved in the industry, issues over succession planning in some businesses, and the prospects of scale offering opportunities for back office and compliance savings. Consolidation has also been a big theme in the sector internationally. Arachas, the acquisitive Irish brokerage group that was bought last year by larger, private equity-backed UK peer Ardonagh Group for about \u20ac250 million, continued on its own deals trail this week by agreeing to buy Waterford-based Hooper Dolan in a deal believed to be worth more than \u20ac60 million. Elsewhere, US insurance brokerage group Brown & Brown struck a deal in December to buy the general insurance business of Cork-based O\u2019Leary Insurances for a reported \u20ac100 million.",

            "raw_text": "Aviva in Ireland is getting back into health insurance eight years after exiting. It plans to launch a joint venture with a group including the insurer\u2019s former chief executive, Jim Dowdall, and one-time VHI head Oliver Tattan. The new venture \u2013 which has yet to be given a name \u2013 will commence selling private health insurance in the second half of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals,  Aviva  said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAviva is delighted to support the set-up of an exciting new health insurance business in Ireland. This is great news for Irish consumers as it will provide greater choice and value,\u201d said Declan O\u2019Rourke, chief executive of Aviva Insurance Ireland. \u201cThis investment expands Aviva\u2019s offering in Ireland to general, life and health Insurance and further demonstrates Aviva\u2019s commitment to continue to grow in Ireland as a leading financial services provider.\u201d Aviva sold its previous health unit, Aviva Health, in 2016 to Irish Life. Irish Life also moved at the same time to buy out the 51 per cent of another provider, GloHealth, it did not already own. The combined business was renamed Irish Life Health and is now the smallest of the three existing private health players in the market. The second-largest player in the market, Laya Healthcare, was acquired for \u20ac650 million by Axa Ireland, the largest general insurance company. Laya traces its roots back to the formation of Bupa Ireland in 1997 and also went through periods of ownership by businessman Se\u00e1n Quinn, the company\u2019s management team, and, more recently, US insurance giant AIG. State-owned VHI remains the largest health insurer in the market with more than 1.2 million medical coverage customers, giving it an almost 49 per cent market share. Mr Dowdall served as chief executive of Aviva Ireland between 2010 and 2011. He had joined the business in 2008, after Aviva acquired Vivas, a health insurance company he cofounded in 2004 with Mr Tatten. The executive went on to co-found GloHealth with Mr Tatten, before becoming managing director of Irish Life Health in 2016. He stepped from that role in 2021, but remained a strategic adviser to the business until April last year. Mr Tatten served as chief executive of VHI between 1998 and 2001 and has been a serial entrepreneur ever since. The third figure in the group planning the Aviva joint venture is Stephen Loughman, a former actuary with VHI during Mr Tatten\u2019s time with the company, who would go on to serve as CFO at Vivas, GloHealth and Irish Life Health. Health insurance premiums rose by an average of 10 per cent last year to \u20ac1,594, according to the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), amid a rising number of claims and costs.  VHI  and  Laya  have increased their coverage costs again in the early months of this year. The planned new entrant \u201cis welcome news for all consumers who are struggling with soaring health insurance costs and are finding themselves under financial pressure to maintain their health cover\u201d, said Dermot Goode of Totalhealthcover.ie. \u201cUltimately, there\u2019s nothing like extra competition to drive better value for all consumers and employers.\u201d Despite the increased cost, the number of individuals with private coverage rose last year by 1.6 per cent to 2.48 million, HIA said in its latest annual market report.

            "raw_text": "The Central Bank said on Thursday that it has fined Dundalk-based insurance broker Keystone Insurance \u20ac41,385 for overcharging customers and providing unclear information on fees. A regulatory investigation found that Keystone Insurance overcharged 62 customers a total of \u20ac9,964.36 over a five-year period to the end of 2017. All of these have been reimbursed, it said. The Central Bank also concluded that 190 of 265 customer invoices reviewed failed to bring fees to the attention of clients, resulting in them not being fully aware of what they were being charged. All told, the bank said that Keystone Insurance was responsible for six breaches of the Consumer Protection Code 2012. The firm admitted to all six breaches as part of a settlement agreement, it said. Representatives from the company were not immediately available for comment. \u201cThe purchase of everyday financial products by consumers can be a complex and daunting process.

Adequate processes \u201cIn this case, as a result of not having the adequate processes, systems and controls, Keystone overcharged 62 customers and 190 of their customers were sent unclear communications on what fees they were being charged.\u201d The investigation stemmed from an on-site inspection of Keystone Insurance by supervisors in June 2017.

            "raw_text": "Almost a third of travel insurance claims processed by one of the leading providers in the State were made before trips were due to take place. According to data from Multitrip.com, 29 per cent of claims were made as a result of sickness, death or other circumstances that meant that people could not take trips as planned. The figure points to the need for people to take out travel insurance as soon as they book their trip rather than waiting until close to the time of departure before taking out cover. \u201cIf you wait until closer to the date of departure to arrange your travel insurance and then find yourself in the unfortunate position of not being able to travel \u2013 because you or your travel companion or a close relative is diagnosed with a serious illness, for example \u2013 you may not be able to recover the cost of your trip, said company spokesman Jason Whelan. He noted that the cost of travel insurance \u201cdoesn\u2019t get any cheaper if you leave it to the last minute so there really is no benefit to delaying the purchase of cover. Travel insurance is too important to be an afterthought.\u201d A significant percentage of Irish people travel without insurance, particularly for short trips and European breaks, despite the high cost of cancelling or curtailing a holiday. A serious heart attack in the US will easily cost \u20ac200,000, while a hip replacement in a private UK hospital will cost \u20ac30,000.

            "title": "Health insurance: How to side-step the dizzying complexity of changing plans or provider and save yourself thousands",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2024-01-15",
            "raw_text": "\u201cSwitching is a con. It is too complicated, you can only do it once a year and there are no real savings to be made.\u201d That was the hot take on health insurance from someone Pricewatch was talking to in the middle of last week. The person was almost entirely wrong, but we will get to all the reasons why they were wrong presently. First, we have some bad news. Last year was \u201cterrible\u201d for more than two million people with private health insurance. The impact of much of that terribleness will only be felt by many in the weeks ahead. The three health insurance providers \u2013 VHI, Laya and Irish Life Health \u2013 all hiked premiums at least twice last year, but because of the way the market works, those increases will only impact hundreds of thousands of customers in the weeks ahead. Unlike gas, broadband or interest rate increases, the cost of health insurance premiums only go up \u2013 or down \u2013 at the time of a policy\u2019s renewal. [\u00a0 Ten cost-of-living changes that could save you \u20ac2,000 a year \u00a0] That means those whose annual contracts end between now and the end of February \u2013 by far the busiest renewal period \u2013 are likely to see the annual cost of their premiums climb by anywhere between \u20ac150 and \u20ac550. People on the most expensive plans are likely to see even more significant increases. Health insurance is the bread-and-butter business of Dermot Goode of  Totalhealthcover.ie , and he warns that while 2023 was \u201ca terrible year\u201d as a result of hikes which will have a cumulative impact of \u201cup to 15 per cent\u201d, we can expect \u201cmore of the same for 2024\u2033. Some of the same has already happened, with Irish Life Health recently rolling out another increase averaging 4.8 per cent. Given the way the sector works, we can expect the other insurers to follow suit. The providers blame the ongoing cost-of-living crisis as well as healthcare-specific inflationary pressures and a greater demand for services in the post-pandemic period, but whatever is behind the spiralling costs, it is consumers who are paying the price. \u201cWhat this means is that all members must now shop around for better value cover to try and avoid these price hikes,\u201d Goode suggests. The shopping-around hymn sheet is one he has been singing from for a long time \u2013 and with good reason. As we have said on this page on many, many occasions in the past, far too many people simply do not shop around when it comes to health insurance. That fact was underscored by research published last week. In its annual consumer survey, the  Health Insurance Authority  (HIA) found that 71 per cent of the more than 2 million people with private health insurance have never moved provider. The average length of time people have had a health insurance policy is 20 years, while the average length of time people have stayed with their current provider is 15 years, the survey said. Almost 70 per cent have no plans to change their cover when their renewal is due. The reasons cited for not changing included being happy with their current provider or believing that the cost saving would not be enough to entice them to switch. According to the survey, 44 per cent of people acknowledge that it can be difficult to understand how health insurance works, along with the terminology that is used. However, just 15 per cent of those who took part in the survey said they would find it very difficult to change health insurance, which, the HIA said, \u201cimplies that most people do not find it challenging despite the proliferation of plans\u201d. HIA chief executive Ray Dolan noted this \u201cconsumer inertia\u201d, and urged people to shop around. The first thing you need to do is arm yourself with some facts. Call your current provider to see whether if they have a lower-cost equivalent plan to the one you are currently on \u201cConsumers don\u2019t necessarily have to change provider \u2013 switching between plans with the same providers is also an option,\u201d he said. The lack of switching means that many people reading this sentence right now will waste hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of euro over the next 12 months by accepting the status quo, rather than asking themselves and their providers some simple questions. What is possibly even worse than all the wasted money is that many of those who are not proactive when it comes to monitoring their health insurance might even be denying themselves a higher level of cover. The benefits of switching are enhanced for older people who tend to pay more for their cover. How much more? Well, people over the age of 65 typically pay between 40 and 45 per cent more for cover than younger people. They are also less likely to switch, which puts them at higher risk of being on dated plans. It is also frequently the case that the older the plan, the higher the price. It should not come as any great surprise to learn that we are not a switching nation. [\u00a0 Health insurance mix-up: Medical treatment of \u20ac10,000 not covered by woman\u2019s policy \u00a0] Most of us stay with the banks of our childhood or early adulthood, no matter what the cost or what they do to us, while well over two-thirds of people never change their gas or energy providers \u2013 even when doing so can see annual bills fall by hundreds of euro. So, if we won\u2019t change something as basic as our electricity provider when to do so comes with absolutely no consequences other than money saving, is any wonder most people never switch health insurance provider? It is, after all, more complex \u2013 a lot more complex. There are more than 300 different plans to choose from, all of which cover a dizzying array of potential conditions. Do you want a private or a semi-private room? Would you be grand in a ward? Do you want access to all hospitals or can you do without the high-tech ones? Do you need enhanced cover for eyes or hips? How\u2019s your heart doing? Are you happy to pay an excess? Is that excess per night or stay? On and on through the questions you might have go. On top of all that, most of us are pretty risk-averse at the best of times, more so when it comes to our health. It is entirely understandable to be afraid of making a mistake by switching to a policy that does not cover what we need when we need it. And of course, it is even more understandable for this fear to come into sharper focus if you have a pre-existing condition, and are concerned that by switching you might lose cover or have to wait for coverage to kick in. The good news is that much of the complexity is easy to side-step and it is probably harder to get wrong than many people might think. There are some very strict rules in place that give consumers protection irrespective of their age or their health issues. A person who has a long-standing policy with Company A will have already been through their waiting periods and can switch to Company B and get all the existing cover they had with Company A immediately. To put that more simply, you do not lose the cover you already have by moving from one company to another. If the plan on the table from Company B offers enhanced cover, you will most likely have to wait for that to kick in, but whatever you had, you keep. Unlike with other forms of insurance, you cannot be penalised financially because of a pre-existing condition or because of your age. When it comes to health insurance, everyone is considered equal in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of the providers. Ultimately, the questions customers should ask can be distilled down to three \u2013 although we are not suggesting you limit yourself to them. The first question is: \u201cDoes the plan I am on offer me value for money?\u201d The second question is: \u201cCould I get a comparable level of cover for less either with my current provider or one of its two competitors?\u201d And the third question is: \u201dHow long have I been on the same policy?\u201d If the answer to that last question is more than five years, then you are probably overpaying by about 25 per cent. If you are talking to a different provider, be upfront, bearing in mind you will not be penalised for honesty How is that possible? Well, for starters, all providers like to introduce new plans to bedazzle potential customers, with the newer policies having more attractive pricing than older legacy plans. So what do you need to know? Well, for starters, timing is crucial. You can only change providers \u2013 without facing a financial penalty \u2013 once a year, when your annual contract ends. For most people, the contract terminates in the first three months of the year. The first thing you need to do is arm yourself with some facts. Call your current provider to see whether they have a lower-cost equivalent plan to the one you are currently on and make it clear you are happy to take on some minor reductions, depending on the savings. [\u00a0 Cost of living: Drop your loyalty, laziness and fear and save up to \u20ac5,000 a year by switching \u00a0] Your existing insurer will already have a complete record of all previous claims you have made, so the simplest question to ask is whether any new and cheaper plans would have covered all the claims that have been paid out over the last two years and to the same level. If the answer is yes, then your choice is pretty simple. If you are talking to a different provider, be upfront, bearing in mind you will not be penalised for honesty. Detail all the important elements of your existing policy, and outline any underlying conditions and procedures carried out. Have them confirm that any new and cheaper plan will cover everything you have had covered in the past. It is also key to do this over the phone rather than online. Providers like it when we shop online, but by doing so we become responsible for all the decisions, be they good or bad. By talking to a company representative and asking the right questions, and insisting on having everything explained \u2013 and don\u2019t feel bad about asking questions \u2013 you put the onus on them to make everything clear. Remember, calls will be recorded \u201cfor training and quality purposes\u201d, so they can\u2019t take you down the garden path over what is actually said. According to the Health Insurance Authority, the number of people with private health insurance is rising, but not as fast as in 2022. As of last September, 2.48 million people in the State had private health insurance. That\u2019s 46.8 per cent of the population. Christina Prendergast of the HIA says that older people, especially, are overpaying by up to 42 per cent. \u201cSome of the policies for people whose circumstances have changed are no longer relevant \u2013 for example, if you now qualify for GP card, or medical card, you don\u2019t need the day-to-day cover for claiming back on GP visits. Some people have very high cover for private hospital beds in private hospitals, and they really aren\u2019t wedded to that at all \u2013 they just want to know that they can get in somewhere if they need to. Some of the newer policies cover a lot for day-to-day cover, and can be a lot cheaper.\u201d She adds that in some circumstances, people can lose cover by not shopping around. \u201cWe have seen reductions in the cover on a small number of specific plans during the past year. If you are on a corporate plan that is tailored for a company or group of companies\u2019 needs, and the company or companies decide that they don\u2019t want to pay, for example, for full orthopaedic cover any more, then your plan changes at renewal. If you auto renew without checking your cover, then you may find a year later that you don\u2019t have the cover that you wanted.\u201d She says the over-65s are at the highest risk of paying over the odds. \u201cIt\u2019s not down to them being older/sicker necessarily and therefore being \u2018riskier\u2019 to insure. It is because they have never switched and are possibly on legacy policies which just might not suit them any more, or there are other very similar products in the market which cost less.\u201d She does say a caveat to this is that full orthopaedic cover generally does cost more, and for the majority of older people, full orthopaedic is a big consideration. Something like this increases the price of the plan as well. When it comes to saving money, Dermot Goode says the \u201cbest advice is to decide on your budget and simply call your current insurer and ask them to find the closest equivalent plan to your existing cover that fits this budget. If you\u2019re not happy with their recommendation, then you should repeat this process with the other insurers. \u201cAs all the rates are set, this approach doesn\u2019t compromise your negotiating position at all.\u201d Remember, there is no reward for customer loyalty in health insurance \u2014 Dermot Goode, totalhealthcover.ie He points to other tips that could help to reduce your costs. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to take on a small excess per claim (for private hospitals only)  [ and consider splitting your cover.\u201d That means putting adults and children on different plans \u2013 there are no private hospitals for children so it doesn\u2019t make any sense to have them on the exact same plans as you.  and  Check out any special deals such as discounted or free cover for children under 18. \u201cConsider reducing your accommodation cover [and] consider \u2018network\u2019 plans which cover selected hospitals for a lower premium,\u201d Goode continues. He also suggests that if dealing with all this  it  seems daunting, people should \u201chave a trusted friend or family member do this for you\u201d, and adds that for people who are \u201cnervous about making changes, there are plenty of qualified advisers who specialise in this area who may be able to assist you\u201d. \u201cThe final piece of advice is never \u2018auto-renew\u2019, as this means your existing policy will simply roll over for another year. At the very least, call your existing insurer to see what other deals might be suitable for you.\u201d He says people should think of health insurance as they would car or home insurance. \u201cEngage with your insurer as early as possible to get a better deal. Rates are spiralling, but there are new plans and deals coming on-stream almost monthly to suit all budgets and requirements.   Remember that nearly 50 per cent of those who shop around get a better value plan with the same insurer. Even if a switch to a new insurer is necessary, rest assured that the legislation protects you in that you won\u2019t need to serve all the new-member waiting periods all over again.\u201d He stresses the importance of disclosing everything to the new insurer in terms of your existing policy, medical history, pending treatment and cover preferences, and have them confirm everything to you over the phone so you can make an informed decision. \u201cRemember, there is no reward for customer loyalty in health insurance, [and] irrespective of whether you\u2019re with the same insurer for five years or 25 years, each member will be treated the same and all claims will be assessed based on your policy terms and conditions effective from your last renewal date. \u201cFinally, if you have elderly parents or relatives who are stuck on the some of the older plans costing \u20ac3,000 per adult or more, do them a favour and help them to review their cover to get a better deal. They could be missing out on potential savings of up to \u20ac1,000 per adult.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Average charges incurred on Irish pensions sit at about 0.8 per cent per year, with proposed auto-enrolment likely to put further downward pressure on administration fees, according to research from Insurance Ireland. A paper published by the insurance lobby group on Friday refutes a 2021 report, which claims that average annual pension charges of 3 per cent in Ireland are eating up as much as 60 per cent of retirement pots. It suggests that the average 0.8 per cent Reduction in Yield (RIY) incurred by Irish pension holders from administration charges was \u201cgood value\u201d. The RIY calculation looks at projected pension benefits where no charges are applied and then reruns the calculation with pension charges included. Insurance Ireland highlights that its analysis is in line with a 2012 report from the Department of Social Protection, which found that the average charge for pension schemes was 0.84 per cent. This was based on information provided by the trustees of 340 occupational pension schemes here. The group called for improved transparency around the charges and fees involved with pensions. An unauthored report provided to the Labour Party in 2021 stated that about 3 per cent was deducted from the value of a pension fund annually due to pension charges. It added that an average of 35 to 45 per cent of pension pots were being eaten up by these charges, with the possibility that the proportion lost could be as high as 60 per cent of the pension total in some cases. \u2018You can\u2019t decarbonise without digitisation, you can\u2019t increase digitisation without data centres\u2019 Insurance Ireland has said the figures were \u201csimply not correct\u201d, and were based on maximum figures mentioned in the 2012 Department of Social Protection report, rather than average charges. Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of Insurance Ireland, said that as the country moves towards an auto-enrolment system of pension savings, \u201cthe subject of pension charges will be increasingly debated\u201d. The Government has proposed to introduce auto-enrolment by 2024, with a proposed maximum charge of 0.5 per cent on the State retirement savings scheme. The research paper also noted the impact of an EU directive signed into Irish law in 2021, which makes it more onerous for employers to run stand-alone pension schemes, and encourages them to use shared master trust pension arrangements with reduced administration costs.",

            "raw_text": "Those with holiday plans this summer are being urged to check the limits of their insurance cover, as insurers say strikes and protests have \u201cplayed havoc\u201d with travel plans in recent months and may not be covered. Irish travel insurance provider Peopl Insurance warned that as a wave of industrial action and civil unrest spreads across Europe and further afield, holidaymakers should check that they are covered for any possible disruptions to their plans. Cost of living concerns are at the heart of many of the strikes that have already taken place \u2013 including air traffic control, airport baggage handling, airport security, and train and rail strikes, Peopl Insurance chief executive Paul Walsh said in a statement. \u201cAs it could be some time before inflation significantly eases, such industrial action is likely to continue for some time \u2013 and certainly throughout the peak holiday months,\u201d he said. Mr Walsh said that only some travel insurance policies will cover you if you have to abandon a holiday, miss a flight, or delay a trip as a result of an unexpected work stoppage or strike at an airport or ferry port. \u201cOther travel insurers don\u2019t cover strikes and with some policies, the cover is more restricted than others. So, it is very important to check the small print of a travel insurance policy before you buy,\u201d he said. The insurer advised holidaymakers to check their cover for unrest, such as those seen in France over pension reforms and cost of living demonstrations across Europe, as well as extreme weather events. Irish tourists had to be evacuated from areas ravaged by wildfires last summer in parts of Italy, France and Portugal, and as wildfires have already broken out in parts of Spain this year, Mr Walsh urged travellers to \u201ccheck the small print on your policy\u201d. In addition to checking the fine print of insurance terms, Peopl Insurance has also advised holidaymakers to take out insurance at the time of booking a holiday, and to buy an excess waiver. When it comes to making a claim, holidaymakers should notify their insurer as soon as possible after the event, and be sure to follow the correct procedure \u2013 for example if possessions are stolen, then people should report it to the local police, or if a traveller has to cancel a trip due to ill health, they may have to file a medical report.",

            "raw_text": "Drivers could benefit from lower motor insurance costs following an investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). Motor insurers AIG, Allianz, Axa, Aviva, FBD and broker AA Ireland have pledged to reform compliance on foot of a CCPC inquiry into allegations that industry players were \"signalling\" price increases to each other. The companies\u2019 deal with the commission is meant to boost competition among motor insurers, potentially leading to lower premiums for drivers. Brian McHugh, CCPC member responsible for competition enforcement, pointed out that businesses must set prices independently. \u201cAny form of pricing statements and suspected co-ordination that could manipulate future pricing raise serious concerns under competition law, as this can impact on competition and ultimately the price consumers pay,\u201d he said. Consumer harm Mr McHugh added that the potential for consumer harm was particularly high in motor insurance, as the law obliged consumers to buy it. Sources say it will be hard to quantify the agreement\u2019s impact on prices, but predicted that improved competition between the companies would cut charges. The commission began investigating the insurers following a series of detailed public statements outlining their future premium increases in 2015 and 2016. Regulators suspected \u201cprice signalling\u201d, a breach of competition law, as it allows businesses to follow each other\u2019s examples when setting charges. The insurers have made legally binding commitments to the commission to reform compliance practices. Independent experts will monitor this. \u2018Culture of compliance\u2019 The commission will publish details of the agreements on Friday. The businesses involved account for 70 per cent of the market. However, Brokers Ireland is not part of the settlement. Its chief executive, Diarmuid Kelly, said the CCPC never proved anti-competitive behaviour on the part of the Irish Brokers' Association, which his organisation took over in 2017. Mr Kelly maintained that the \u201cculture of compliance\u201d the regulator sought was already in place when the organisations merged. Mr McHugh argued that Brokers Ireland had a responsibility to address the IBA\u2019s behaviour, which raised competition law concerns. \u201cThe fact that Brokers Ireland did not enter into legally binding commitments, in the CCPC\u2019s view arguably calls into question the organisational attitude towards compliance,\u201d he added.",

            "raw_text": "Almost half the population has some form of health insurance and the concept is now so deeply integrated into the Irish healthcare system that we tend to lose sight of the fact that the companies involved are out to make profits. This particular chicken has come home to roost in the provision of advanced drugs for the treatment of cancer. Two leading oncologists this week accused two of the three large health insurers, Irish Life and Laya, of \u201chiding behind\u201d the lengthy process by which the HSE approves new cancer therapies for use in the public system. The process can take up to two years from when the drugs are approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is one of the slowest in the EU. The third and largest player in the market \u2013 State-owned VHI \u2013 does not wait for the HSE and usually reimburses its customers within a couple of months of EMA approval. The key word here is customers. VHI is an insurance company run on commercial lines, as are the other two players. The obvious question is why Irish Life and Laya\u2019s customers don\u2019t become customers of VHI and avail of its more proactive approach to cancer drugs. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 There is more than one reason but the most obvious is that health insurers don\u2019t cover new customers for pre-existing conditions. This is normal enough in insurance \u2013 you can\u2019t insure against an event once it has happened \u2013 but in the health insurance market it appears to thwart competition. Laya and Irish Life can drag their feet on covering new cancer drugs secure in the knowledge that their customers have limited alternatives. Private health insurers are regulated by the Government through the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) in recognition both of their importance to the healthcare system and the various structural obstacles that militate against full competition. The HIA\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d is for a \u201cwell-regulated, competitive health insurance market where consumers are empowered to make informed decisions\u201d. This does not sound like a description of the status quo as it pertains in the area of advanced cancer drugs. At a very minimum the HIA needs to make consumers aware of the difference between the three players in this regard and not leave it to doctors to raise public awareness. It is not clear if the HIA has the power to go further. Its job is to ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Acts and legislation is a matter for the Government. It might be simpler to accelerate the HSE approval process for these drugs. The affair also highlights a central issue with the health system. It is biased, particularly in terms of speed of access, in favour of the bettter- off, who can afford private insurance. Sl\u00e1intecare is designed to create a level playing field, at least in terms of essential treatments, but there is still a long way to go here.",

            "author": "Dominic Coyle",
            "date": "2021-03-30",
            "raw_text": "I notice that you get a lot of queries about inheritance. I know it can be a very complicated area but I remember hearing about an insurance policy that you can get and you will not have to pay inheritance tax. Is that so and does it still exist? How does it work? Would it make sense for someone like me who does not have much in savings? My house will be the main thing that I leave to my two children. It is currently worth  about \u20ac700,000. \u2013 Ms G T , email  You remember right. And it does still exist. They are called section 72 policies, but whether they make sense to use is a different matter. As you can imagine, given they cover a tax bill, these policies are tightly regulated and they are useful only to people with very large estates or whose beneficiaries would not have the wherewithal to settle an inheritance tax bill without, for instance, selling the family home that has been left to them. So how do they work? Essentially, a section 72 policy is designed to meet some or all of an expected inheritance tax bill. However, while inheritance tax bills are paid by beneficiaries under Irish law, a section 72 policy is taken out by the person who currently owns them. Yes, the people who pay the bill will derive no benefit from the policy for which they are paying the premiums. It is, as Nick McGowan of Lion.ie Life Insurance puts it, a case of you paying for the insurance to hand over a house that you already spent 35 years paying off a mortgage on. As I said above, it makes sense only for a limited group of people. If the estate is particularly large, paying the premiums reduces the amount of assets exposed to inheritance tax in your death and therefore the amount that needs to be covered. A lot of families would not have those cash savings lying around \u2013 especially with a mortgage and young children of their own Separately, for those whose beneficiaries are cash poor, it allows parents, or whomever, to make sure that a prized family asset \u2013 such as the family home \u2013 passes on down the family without having to be sold to meet the tax bill. If you consider a property worth \u20ac500,000 \u2013 and there is plenty of those in Dublin at least \u2013 that parents want to leave to their only child, it will be well in excess of the current \u20ac335,000 tax-free limit on inheritances from a parent to a child. Even if there were no other assets inherited, the child would face a bill of \u20ac54,450 on the \u20ac165,000 by which the value of the property exceeds their tax-free threshold. A lot of families would not have those cash savings lying around \u2013 especially with a mortgage and young children of their own. The only way to meet the bill would be to sell the house. That\u2019s what the section 72 policy avoids. The key thing is, although the policy is taken out by the person who has died, it does not form part of their estate as long as it is earmarked for an inheritance tax bill. Instead it is paid to the executor or personal representative handling the dead person\u2019s affairs. What does it cost? Well, it\u2019s expensive, there\u2019s no getting around that. There are two reasons for this. First, section 72s are guaranteed whole-of-life policies: they continue until you die regardless of what age that might be and they are not subject to the sort of endless upward revision of premiums that makes most regular whole-of-life policies impossibly expensive as one gets older. The flip side of that is that you do pay more for the cover from the outset than you would under policies where premiums can be reviewed. Secondly, for couples, they most commonly pay out on a second life basis. When a person dies, their spouse can inherit everything from them with no inheritance tax issue. The tax issue only arises when the second person dies and their assets are passed on to other family members or friends. We\u2019re more used to policies, such as mortgage protection, which pay out on the first death in a couple. Those factors aside, there are also the usual issues that impact life insurance policy premiums \u2013 your age, your lifestyle (do you drink or smoke), your health at the time you take out the policy and, of course, the amount of cover you\u2019re looking for. I asked Royal London to give me a few examples so that readers might get a sense of the cost involved. The key thing is to assess how much needs to be covered \u2013 and remember, it is not the value of the inheritance that you need to cover but the amount of inheritance tax that would have to be paid on it. The policy will pay out a set amount, though some providers do allow you to adjust this over the life of the policy. If it is too low, some inheritance tax will remain to be paid. If it is too high \u2013 maybe because you sell some assets between now and then \u2013 the excess will be treated as an asset of the estate and subject to inheritance tax itself. Naturally, if there are cash savings as part of the estate \u2013 or easily liquidated assets \u2013 you might not need to cover the full bill. Similarly, if the beneficiaries have their own cash resources. In this case, we worked on the basis of a potential tax bill of \u20ac500,000, so it is clearly a big estate with \u20ac1.5 million of assets over and above the tax-free threshold. In all cases, these quotes are for policies paying out on second death. For a couple aged 64 and 60, who are both relatively healthy with no illness or conditions, Royal London says they could expect to pay about \u20ac907.35 a month. That assumes neither smoke and that their alcohol consumption is within normal guideline levels, with no history of alcohol abuse. Age, lifestyle or illness can increase those figures dramatically. For instance, a couple aged 72 and 70, where the older person smokes about 20 cigarettes a day and is in remission for testicular cancer for the past five years, would expect to pay about \u20ac1,855.67 a month, according to Royal London. The big issue is affordability. If you stop paying the premiums, the cover dies and you're back to square one The couple would need to have an otherwise clean bill of health from their general practitioner, including confirmation that there has been no recurrence of the cancer and that the second person covered has no lifestyle or increased medical risks. If the smoker was the younger person in that same couple \u2013 the 70-year-old \u2013 and she was in remission for breast cancer by three years, they could expect to pay about \u20ac2,070.58 a month \u2013 more than \u20ac200 extra each month \u2013 with the other circumstances the same as above. Is it worth it? Well, if you\u2019re the clean-living healthy couple of 64 and 60 above, your premiums amount to \u20ac10,888.20 a year. It\u2019s an awful lot of money but you would need to be paying premiums for almost 46 years before the insurance company was winning on the deal. The big issue is affordability. If you stop paying the premiums, the cover dies and you\u2019re back to square one. That\u2019s a big consideration when you look at the size of the premiums and the fact that older people tend to have dramatically reduced income. And remember, even after the first person dies, the surviving member of the couple needs to keep paying those premiums or the whole arrangement falls. Can they afford that? Of course, the children \u2013 and it will most likely be for the couple\u2019s children that they would consider such an expense \u2013 will benefit and they can use the small gift allowance to help meet the cost of premiums if they have the resources. But it is still a big ask. If it is something you want to consider \u2013 and that's most unlikely on an estate like yours \u2013 there are, I gather, only three insurance companies in Ireland that deal with these policies. They are: Royal London, Zurich and Irish Life. The other limiting factor is age. You must be at least 18 to take out a policy but, more relevant for most of us, you need to do so before you turn 75. With two children, they are entitled to inherit \u20ac670,000 between them . . . just \u20ac30,000 shy of your home\u2019s value. As of now, they would face a bill of \u20ac5,000 each, which should not require such a policy.",

In a letter sent on Wednesday to providers, Ms Zappone wrote that Allianz \"has agreed that there will be no Covid-19 exclusion on insurance policies\". \u201cAll covers will be in place as per their existing policies, provided they follow the guidelines and back-to-work protocols issued by the relevant authorities,\u201d Ms Zappone wrote. She also told providers that assurances had been given by Arachas, the insurance broker which provides services to many operators in the sector. Earlier this month, a letter from Arachas raising concerns about the extension of insurance to operators in the sector partaking in a dedicated scheme for healthcare workers was among the factors that led to that scheme being shut down. \u201c[Arachas] have advised DCYA [the Department of Children and Youth Affairs] that, from the insurance point of view, there should be no barrier to the reopening of childcare services on the 29th of June,\u201d she told the providers. The circular also outlines more detail about the proposed \u201cplay-pod\u201d system, which would result in children being placed with the same teachers and the same group of children in the same physical location every day. This is in an effort to minimise the risk of infection, and also to allow the containment of an infection and facilitate contact tracing if one occurs. The providers were told that \u201cas far as possible, there should be no contact between two \u2018play-pods\u2019 . . . [they] should remain apart in shared space and during drop off and collection times.\u201d Large rooms, the document says, may contain more than one play-pod, provided there are partitions that prevent physical contact between them. Toys should not be shared and staff from different pods will be asked to maintain social distancing. The document states the maximum size of a play-pod \u2013 which will be key for many operators, who are trying to establish their capacity and how the space of their premises may be adapted \u2013 will \u201cbe confirmed in the coming days\u201d. Ms Zappone is expected to bring a memo to cabinet on Friday on certain measures relating to reopening of childcare, including play-pod sizes. Elsewhere, Siptu has published the results of a survey of 6,000 early years professionals on reopening. It showed that for early years educators, the biggest issue was social distancing, raised by 81 per cent of respondents, followed by the quality of interactions with children (74 per cent). Among managers and owners, financial sustainability was the biggest issue cited (79 per cent of respondents), followed by the issue of reduced adult/child ratios, raised by 74 per cent.",

The broker said \u201csome clarity has now been provided\u201d in the insurance industry on the matter following \u201cweeks of uncertainty\u201d. Up until now, it was difficult for Ukrainian motorists to secure insurance in Ireland as most insurers would not accept a Ukrainian driving licence. In normal circumstances, all drivers arriving from overseas would have to provide written proof of their driving experience, which would usually come from their previous insurers. However, due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, accessing this documentation is problematic. Coverinaclick.ie managing director Jonathan Hehir said some insurers are demonstrating \"great flexibility for refugees from Ukraine\", waiving some of the requirements so as to allow people to get on the road as soon as possible, if they have access to a vehicle. \u201cThis should enable more to enter the workforce sooner than they might otherwise have done so,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, although it\u2019s obvious that very few people will have taken a car with them to Ireland from the Ukraine, where once there would have been an issue insuring a left-hand drive car, this should also not be a barrier to securing insurance cover from certain insurers.\u201d Mr Hehir said the online broker was now in a position to arrange insurance for drivers holding Ukrainian driving licences, although it has only reached agreement with \u201ca couple of insurers\u201d. \u201cThere are ongoing developments within the industry and while we have agreement with a couple of insurers, we are expecting more to follow suit,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last few weeks, we have been working with insurers to ascertain how we could secure motor insurance cover for those travelling here from the Ukraine. \u201cDevelopments over recent days mean that we can now secure new car policies on the basis that Ukrainian driver\u2019s licences will effectively be treated the same as EU licences, so the route to securing cover is pretty straightforward. \u201cWhen it comes to driving experience, such as whether a person has previous crashes or claims, the word of the driver will be deemed sufficient, rather than them insisting on paperwork from their previous insurer, as would normally be the case. \u201cThis is a unique situation, and we applaud the flexibility shown by some insurers who, in some cases, are agreeing to effectively take on more risk without additional premium.\u201d Coverinaclick is reporting that, in certain cases, a Ukrainian driver aged above 25, with a full clean Ukrainian driving licence, can be added to certain existing Irish car insurance policies temporarily for up to 30 days at no additional cost.",

Mr Desmond, who operates Electric Picnic with Live Nation, said \u201cwe had cover and we have had no issues getting payment\u201d. He made the comments as new accounts for the Live Nation controlled Festival Republic Ltd in the UK show that it received a Covid related insurance payout of \u00a313.27 million (\u20ac15.52 million) for 2020. A director and co-owner of Festival Republic through LN Gaiety Investments, Mr Desmond said the insurance payment to Festival Republic related to insurance for 2020 events cancelled due to Covid-19.

Counts show the firm\u2019s revenues plummeted by 98.7 per cent from \u00a356.42 million to \u00a3732,681 last year. The company recorded a pre-tax profit of \u00a38.42 million after recording \"other operating income\" of \u00a314 million, made up of the insurance payout of \u00a313.27 million and \u00a3738,862 in payments from the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

            "raw_text": "Arachas, an Irish insurance broker that was bought last year by larger UK peer Ardonagh Group, has acquired a Kilkenny-based fintech company as it prepares plans to actively target the consumer market here. The purchase price of Orange Bear, which has a developed digital insurance platform that Arachas sees as key to making inroads in the online consumer market for motor and household coverage, has not been disclosed. Arachas, whose name is Irish for insurance, has focused mainly on commercial lines since it was established 15 years ago through the merger of Cork-based broker Tyrrell Coakley with two Dublin-based peers, Hodgins Percival and Slattery Jermyn. While it has consumer exposure as a result of a flurry of deals in recent years, it has not pursued this segment of the market as strongly as commercial lines before now. \"This acquisition enables us to fulfil our ambition to transform the customer experience using cutting edge technology and to be the leading digital and data driven broker in Ireland, \" said Conor Brennan, chief executive of Arachas for the past three years, having previously headed up both Zurich Insurance Group's UK and Irish general insurance businesses. \u201cWe now have the technology that will make buying insurance online simple and transparent but with a key difference. Our customers will have immediate access to our insurance experts who can advise on the right insurance.\u201d \u2018Simple\u2019 online experience Orange Bear was set up by Kevin McCarthy, another Zurich alumnus. \u201cWe established Orange Bear in 2017 as there was a clear need for a simple consumer experience online when dealing with their insurance needs,\u201d he said. \u201cCombining technology with decades of critical insurance experience, we developed a platform that is potentially the most interesting innovation in the Irish consumer insurance space.\u201d It is expected the technology will be rolled out across the wider Ardonagh Group, which is home to a number of well-known UK brokerages, including Bishopsgate, Towergate and Carole Nash, and led by Westmeath native David Ross. US private-equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Investment Partners originally acquired Arachas last April for \u20ac250 million from London investment firm Sovereign Capital Partners, the Irish business's former chief executive Donal Cronin, and other minority small shareholders. Madison Dearborne and HPS moved in June to roll Arachas into Ardonagh, which the US companies already controlled. Prior to the purchase, Arachas was owned by UK private equity firm Sovereign Capital Partners, the Irish business\u2019s former chief executive Donal Cronin and other minority small shareholders.",

            "author": "Pearse Doherty",
            "date": "2019-11-13",
            "raw_text": "Insurance costs are squeezing incomes and crippling business. For many, insurance cover is not a choice but a legal necessity. Driving without it, for example, is illegal. That is why the insurance industry must be challenged and insurance costs reduced. Business is shutting up shop and that is damaging communities and hitting jobs. A recent survey by Public Participation Networks found that 83 per cent of voluntary and community sector groups faced insurance hikes in the past three years, with a significant number seeing their premiums double and even treble. For drivers, things are no better. The narrative relentlessly pedalled by the industry has been one of a 'compo culture', with consumers footing the bill for out-of-control claims Since 2016 the Government has done nothing to reduce insurance costs and end the rip-off so many face. The Judicial Council Act \u2013 which would pave the way to new guidelines on the size of awards \u2013 gathers dust on the desk of the Justice Minister, while Fianna F\u00e1il have failed to progress a single piece of legislation that would help insurance customers. Thanks to a passive Government, insurance companies are recording large profits while consumers pay ever-rising premiums. The narrative relentlessly pedalled by the industry has been one of a \u201ccompo culture\u201d, with consumers footing the bill for out-of-control claims. This has led to a war of words between two vested interests, the insurance industry and legal profession. But the facts are more important than any spat between Insurance Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland. The insurance industry repeatedly claims that 20 per cent of all claims are fraudulent. But under questioning in the Oireachtas Finance Committee this summer and last month, it emerged that only a small number of claims are reported by these companies to the garda\u00ed as fraud. For example, AXA reported only 1 percent of claims to the garda\u00ed as fraudulent in 2018, not 20 per cent. For Aviva, it was 4 per cent. Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act makes it an offence for a company not to report a crime like fraud. Put simply, the insurance industry is either misleading the public or breaking the law. The facts disagree The industry also tells us that the cost of claims is pushing up premiums. The facts disagree. Across all courts and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the value of personal injury awards fell by 15 per cent from 2014 to 2018, \u20ac65 million less was paid out last year compared to five years ago. According to Insurance Ireland\u2019s own figures, there were 55,000 fewer motor claims in 2017 than in 2014. Yet in the same period the average motor premium rose by 45 per cent. Insurance companies are running complex algorithms using big data to target customers who are deemed less \u201cprice-sensitive\u201d, or more likely to renew their policies. This means companies are penalising loyal customers with artificially high premiums, a practice that is known to harm vulnerable groups, the elderly and low-income households. Instead of giving customers the best deal, they are finding ways to abuse their trust and offer the worst price they can get away with. A practice termed \u201cdual pricing\u201d or \u201cprice optimisation\u201d, I call it \u201cprice discrimination\u201d. In Britain, the Financial Conduct Authority found that 6 million policyholders were overcharged more than \u00a31 billion by companies because of dual pricing in 2018 alone. They are now considering recommendations to stamp it out. It is a practice that is illegal in 17 US states; including California, Florida and Pennsylvania. Irish consumers deserve no less. In September, I submitted a 130-page dossier to the Central Bank requesting an investigation into the practice; to find out how many people it affects, how it harms consumers and how we can stop it. Last week, I met the new Governor and was pleased that he agreed to my request. New Central Bank regulations requiring insurance companies to provide the previous year\u2019s motor premium to a renewing customer were received with much fanfare. In truth it was a long wait for very little. Increasing transparency The Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill currently before the D\u00e1il will go further and move faster, requiring companies to provide customers with the past three years of premiums paid and claims made for all non-life insurance contracts, increasing transparency and strengthening the hands of consumers when they look for a better deal. This legislation is a win for all of us who have or want insurance cover. It is an opportunity to reform insurance contracts Any company that cancels a policy would have to pay the customer the outstanding balance of the premium paid, make it easier for the customer to withdraw from a contract and inform the customer of any claim made that affects their policy. The legislation would make it more difficult for an insurer to refuse payment of a valid claim or change the cover of the policy without reason. This legislation is a win for all of us who have or want insurance cover. It is an opportunity to reform insurance contracts. It is essential that all parties who want to help consumers and businesses suffering from rising insurance costs support this Bill.

            "raw_text": "A family who had let their home insurance cover lapse when they had other bills to pay have been left devastated after a fire gutted their home. Derek Kenneally, his wife, Deirdre, and their three children, Anna (11), Eoin (8) and Oisin (6), have been left with almost nothing following the blaze but are relieved none of the family were injured. The couple, who live in Mullinavat, Co Kilkenny, both work at Waterford University Hospital. Mr Kenneally works as a clinical nurse manager in the emergency department and his wife works in the laboratory. They now want to raise awareness about everything that went wrong for them in the early hours of last Thursday morning so the same does not happen to another family. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 \u201cWe see heartbreak and torment every day in work but when it happens to your own family, it\u2019s just not something you can ever expect or be prepared for,\u201d Mr Kenneally said. \u201cLast Thursday, my eldest daughter had a friend staying over. When we went to bed we told them not to stay up all night chatting. It was a summer night with no school the next morning so we didn\u2019t mind them staying up later than usual.\u201d At around 1:30am the two girls heard crashing and banging coming from the back of the house. \u201cThey looked out the window and saw a bright orange glow,\u201d he said. \u201cThey screamed out to us that the garage was on fire and we leapt out of bed to witness what can only be described as an inferno. I ran out to the back and grabbed the dog from his little run, got everyone out of the house and called the fire brigade.\u201d He told the emergency services the garage was some distance from the house \u2014 approximately 14 feet \u2014 but that he was fearful the house could be in danger too. \u201cWithin five minutes, the fire jumped the 14 feet over to the house,\u201d he said. \u201cFifteen minutes later the house was just unbelievable... the whole roof was in flames. The fire brigade were amazing with how quickly they got here but it all happened so fast.\u201d A Garda fire investigator subsequently told him the cause of the blaze was suspected to be a water pump located in the garage. \u201cWater pumps have a little switch box that contains a solenoid that can overheat,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they can overheat because my father\u2019s one went a couple of years ago and it caught fire. Thankfully, where it happened with him there was nothing near it and it was just the box that went. I had it in a garage/shed where everything was stored, such as old paint cans and other fire accelerants. I\u2019d ask anyone reading this who has a water pump to make sure that there is nothing near it that could be a source of ignition.\u201d Mr Kenneally is now lamenting the circumstances that led to him not renewing his house insurance. \u201cI know the whole country are struggling financially at the moment and we were no different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of those things where you cut corners where you can, and you let things slip. When the house insurance was up for renewal there were so many other outgoings at the time, I put it off until the next month and I have to live with that now. People are telling me that I should have asked for a loan or whatever to pay it but pride will never let you do that. And of course pride is gone out the window now.\u201d In the face of the devastation, all Mr Kenneally can think of now is how the tragedy could have been a lot worse. \u201cIf it was the following night, I would have been at work and there\u2019s a good chance that everyone else would have been asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bear thinking about, really.\u201d Communities around the Kenneally family have rallied around in support and a  Go Fund Me  page set up by Mullinavat GAA Camogie Club has already raised \u20ac28,000, with a target of \u20ac300,000. \u201cI really can\u2019t thank people enough,\u201d said Mr Kenneally.",

            "title": "Who should pay for the insurance on our shared car park?",
            "author": "Wed Feb",
            "date": "2022-02-09",
            "raw_text": "I own 50 per cent of the freehold of the car park in front of our property, along with the other 50 per cent freeholder who owns the lower apartment. There are two other properties on the same site which are also owned freehold, but they do not own the car park. Those two freeholders both have two spaces to park on the car park we own, and they each pay a \u20ac25 per annum service charge towards maintenance; any maintenance costs over and above that \u20ac25 are paid when work is done. Who is responsible for paying the insurance on the car park: the owners/freeholders or the lessees? And does the insurance form part of the service charge that should be divided proportionately, as per the lease? Finbar McDonnell writes:  It is hard to be definitive without knowing more details of the apartment scheme and reviewing the leases, but here are some thoughts based on the information provided. You do not mention an owners\u2019 management company (OMC) so I assume such a structure is not in place and instead the car park arrangements are based on the legal documents signed by the four owners when they purchased their properties. I would note that, while parts of the Multi-Use Development Act (2011) that guides how multi-unit developments (MUDs) are managed relate only to developments of five or more residential units, certain sections apply to developments of between two and four residential units. However, you may feel that such a structure may be overly cumbersome in your case. A service charge is typically levied to cover the cost of services provided to owners or users of a property. In a development involving multiple properties, such as you have, these management services are generally listed in the lease agreements (while allowing flexibility for other required services to be provided). In a standard MUD, these could include insurance of the property, provision for public and employer\u2019s liability insurance for common areas, lighting, cleaning, general maintenance and so forth. In your case, the area under discussion is a surface car park in which it sounds like there are spaces being used by four different properties. Without knowing the specific car park, costs that may require to be met could include insurance (as per the above), electricity costs and maintenance of light fittings, litter picks and other cleaning, vermin control, maintenance of gates for vehicular or pedestrian access, possible CCTV, and maintenance of boundary walls or fencing. It might also be seen as reasonable that annual charges include a contribution towards a sinking fund for occasional larger-scale work such as replacement of gates, or resurfacing of the car park. Given the above, the \u20ac25 a year charge sounds modest, although I note that the two other owners also pay towards other costs above that. The challenge there will be to include both those directly incurred as relating to the car park (such as car park lining) but also any portion of other charges (such as insurance or electricity) that may relate largely to the building but which also, in part, relate to the car park. It may not be feasible to set up a separate insurance policy or electricity meter for the car park, so some kind of apportionment will be needed and there will need to be agreement by those paying the charges that this apportionment has been done in a fair and reasonable manner. As such, and in the absence of sight of the original legal documents, the answer to your specific queries would be that it would seem reasonable that all beneficiaries of the insurance should pay towards the annual premium and the insurance part of the service charge should be divided proportionately. Finally, I would note that two issues on the agenda in many multi-unit developments in 2022 are the lack of secure storage areas for bicycles (including e-bikes) and a need for charge points for electric vehicles. Given your current arrangements, and the possible need for such investments in the coming years, a requirement for flexibility may also be important in any arrangements you reach with the users of all of the car park spaces.

Calling for State intervention, the Alliance, which represents 36 business organisations, warned that irreparable damage could be done to Irish businesses unless insurers \u201cplay their part\u201d. The Covid-19 crisis has prompted complaints from businesses that claim that their insurer won\u2019t pay out on a business interruption policy when the circumstances require them to. High profile company\u2019s such as Press Up and Lemon & Duke have launched legal action against their insurers, RSA and FBD respectively. The alliance suggested that 63 per cent of claims for business interruption insurance have been refused while an additional 33 per cent await a decision. Just 2 per cent of businesses have taken their claim further via the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Forbearance In 18 per cent of cases, insurers were said to have declined any forbearance in the form of rebates, pauses or extensions. And 22 per cent of those who have renewed their insurance cover since the onset of the crisis have seen a rise in their premium despite the vast majority of retail and hospitality outlets having been closed since the middle of March. \"The suggestion that this Covid-19 crisis may prove to be a financial Armageddon for insurers is completely undermined by the relatively low level of requests for business interruption payments or forbearance,\" said Michael Magner, chairman of the Alliance's Covid-19 working group. \"The Central Bank must equally intervene aggressively on behalf of policyholders. General statements are not enough. and the Financial Ombudsman must fast-track complaints already received to give urgent clarity to policyholders on where they stand,\" he said.

            "raw_text": "As FBD, the State's only remaining indigenous insurer, was forced in 2015 to sell property assets and accept a \u20ac70 million rescue investment from Canada's Fairfax Financial, many of its larger overseas-owned rivals took another route to deal with spiralling losses at the time on Irish motor books. In order to avoid the ignominy of potential group bailouts, they entered into large reinsurance contracts with their parent companies in the UK, US and continental Europe to share some of the risks on their Irish books as the industry scrambled to hike premiums to catch up with losses caused by rising personal injury awards. As it happens, EU insurance rules were coming down the tracks at just the right time. The so-called Solvency II directive allowed for, and even encouraged, risk-sharing across the various entities under the umbrella of large insurance groups. The aim was to avoid having capital unnecessarily trapped in various jurisdictions. The Central Bank of Ireland's third annual Private Motor Insurance Report, which draws on figures from the National Claims Information Database (NCID), shows that motor insurers here had been ceding about 7 per cent of their premiums to reinsurers during the first half of the last decade. By 2015, it had jumped to about 33 per cent. Last year it was more than 40 per cent. Almost all of the deals were with other entities within their group structure, and not third parties, according to figures in the report. The reinsurance deals cushioned the losses of Irish motor insurers between 2015 and 2016, providing a bit of stability in the market. Otherwise, who\u2019s to know what mainstream insurers might have decided to join some of the flightier capacity providers that quit the market during the crisis. However, the strong rebound by the industry in recent years \u2013 driven by premium hikes \u2013 has essentially, by virtue of these intragroup reinsurance deals, resulted in much of the profits being recorded not locally, but overseas. The official operating profits recorded by motor insurers operating in the Irish market amounted to \u20ac163 million last year, or 12 per cent of total income. However, that ignores the fact that the report also notes that \u20ac144 million of profits were ceded to reinsurers last year \u2013 mostly related parties. When that\u2019s added in, the total tops \u20ac300 million, or a more eye-watering 22 per cent of total income.",

However some financial damage remains, with the national debt shooting higher and a big hole in the social insurance fund, out of which many State benefits are paid. Social insurance is a fundamental part of Ireland\u2019s economy, offering significant entitlements and benefits in return for contributions, and supporting people through their working lives, and afterwards. However new questions have been raised by the pandemic, which has led to the fund lapsing into a deficit expected to amount to \u20ac3.8 billion this year, Payments out of the fund should fall as the pandemic eases and inflows should pick up. But the longer-term outlook for the fund was already challenging pre-pandemic, as the population ages. Now senior civil servants preparing pre-budget papers for the Government argue that PRSI payments from employers, employees and the self-employed should rise significantly from 2023 on to safeguard future benefits, This opens up two questions. The first is whether the fund should be supported by more payments from contributors or the general exchequer. Given the other pressures on the exchequer, the former seems preferable. The second question then is who pays more and how much do they pay. The civil service papers outline one possible way forward, but this is a political choice \u2013 and not an easy one. The civil servants argue that there is scope to increase payments in Ireland, given that they tend to be higher in other EU countries. This is true up to a point \u2013 and employer contributions are particularly low here. But comparisons here are difficult, as the benefits on offer vary so much from country to country; higher contributions elsewhere often lead to entitlements for improved pensions or healthcare access. More entitlements in return for somewhat higher payments may well be the way forward here, with areas like sick pay and unemployment supports likely to improve post-pandemic. A lot of work is involved in scoping out the options, work which will fall to the commission on taxation and welfare which can have a key role in shaping the agenda.",

            "raw_text": "Hi again, and welcome to this week\u2019s personal finance newsletter. Over one in five children in Ireland has private health insurance, according to figures from 2022 from the  Health Insurance Authority . But do they  need it? In a world where close to half the population has private health insurance, it is not surprising to see so many youngsters with private cover, even where there is no such thing as dedicated private children\u2019s hospitals. And the insurers are understandably quick to market the advantages of having children covered. But health insurance for children can prove costly. The most affordable plans for children range from \u20ac140 for VHI\u2019s Public Plus, to \u20ac194 at Irish Life for its First Cover plan. These are plans that offer basic care. For adults on one of the most popular plans at any of Ireland\u2019s three insurers, the price could tick up substantially. You can expect to pay \u20ac271.50 a year for a child on  VHI\u2019s  One Plus plan, \u20ac319.80 on the Inspire Plus at  Laya Healthcare  which has recently been acquired by Axa and \u20ac532.20 on the Irish Life\u2019s 4D Health 2 plan. These are just sample examples drawn from the five most popular plans at each insurer, as determined by the Health Insurance Authority, but they give some sense of the price you can face. With most insurers raising prices twice this year, many parents are looking closely at their budgets. And for families of school-going children especially, there may be a much cheaper alternative. Among the costs hard-pressed parents face as they get their child ready for each new school year is an insurance premium. Accidents happen and the schools need to ensure they are covered against the medical outcome of the inevitable bumps and scrapes as children career into each other in playgrounds and on playing field. But, depending on your school, that premium could cover much more. School pupil accident cover School pupil accident cover In general, insurers offer two coverage options \u2013 cover for school activities and 24-hour cover. The first, naturally, is cheaper but there is very little in it and the cost is, in any case, just a fraction of the cost of private health insurance. Allianz is one of the big providers, claiming on its site to cover 90 per cent of Ireland\u2019s primary schools and half of all secondary schools. I chose them as an example for no better reason than that they actually publish their premium information in easy to access format on their website, unlike some other providers. So how much does it cost? At primary level, if the school is covering only school-based activities, the premium is just \u20ac5 per pupil per year. If they are going for the 24/7 option, it is \u20ac8. Paying online, which almost all schools would do these days, reduces those figures further to \u20ac4 and \u20ac6.40 respectively. With just \u20ac2.40-\u20ac3 difference, it seems a no-brainer to insure 24/7, covering you against injury either in school, after school hours or even during school holidays. In my experience, most schools opt for the 24/7 cover but parents often do not realise the level of cover they have and are effectively paying twice over to protect their children. The prices at secondary school are slightly higher \u2013 \u20ac9 per annum for school activity only cover (\u20ac7.20 if paid online) and \u20ac12 per pupil for 24/7 cover, or \u20ac9.60 online. Those quoted figures are for compulsory cover where the school (and ultimately the parents) pay for every child. Insurers also offer an opt-in option where the premiums are slightly higher to cover the extra administrations in ploughing through the acceptances of each individual parent. Strange but true Strange but true Sounds too good to be true? It seems so at least if a very unscientific straw poll I conducted is anything to go by. Most parents I spoke to were absolutely unaware their children might be covered out of school hours, with many frankly refusing to accept it was possible. But it is, and parents would be well advised to check with their children\u2019s school to confirm which insurance policy is in place and what it covers. In general, policies will cover medical expenses for accidents that are not otherwise recoverable of up to \u20ac50,000. Clearly, if you have private health cover, the \u201cnot otherwise recoverable\u201d would require you first to check what it will cover\u2026 but there is no need to have private health insurance to qualify. The same cover is generally available for dental treatment, including emergency dental treatment. There are also figures for more significant injury, such as a loss of sight, hearing, speech, a limb or even death ranging from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac100,000. And it does not just cover accidents at home but also worldwide. Not everything is covered and you do need to read the small print as with any insurance contract. Horse riding generally is okay, but not horse racing or jumping unless it is a school activity \u2013 say, in transition year. Similarly, martial arts, boxing or other formal fighting sports are generally excluded, unless organised through the school. And if you are playing sport with a recognised club or association, the medical and dental cover falls to just \u20ac5,000, presumably on the basis that the club or association should have its own insurance cover in place for participants. More importantly, the cover is intended to address physical injury; more general sickness or disease will be excluded. As a result, for some children, it may still make sense to have private cover. But certainly one of the compelling reasons for private health cover no longer applies. Hospital charges for emergency care or per diem charges for in patient care are no longer an issue, having been disposed of in last year\u2019s budget. If you\u2019re looking nervously at those private health insurance bills \u2013 or even if you don\u2019t have private cover and simply worry about the financial impact of the inevitable childhood accidents \u2013 it gives food for thought. Not least the notion that you might have had cover all these years and not been aware of it.

And over four in five pharmacists expect shortages to worsen over the next year. The IPU, which represents 2,300 pharmacists in 1,800 community pharmacies across the State, said the figures highlight the need to expedite the planned introduction of a serious shortage protocol under legislation currently going through the Oireachtas. The Health Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2024 will allow the Minister for Health to introduce a scheme where pharmacists can appropriate substitute medicines for patients without needing to revert to the prescribing doctor. \u201cThis should dramatically speed up the process for both pharmacists and prescribers and crucially will ensure that patients get appropriate medicines quicker,\u201d said Clare Fitzell, IPU\u2019s head of strategic policy. The latest survey of members carried out by the IPU in advance of its national conference in Athlone this weekend found that all pharmacies had experienced medicine shortages in the past four months, with 57 per cent saying they ran into trouble securing supplies of 40 different medicines. Close to two-thirds of pharmacists say allocations imposed by manufacturers are the leading cause of medicine shortages. \u201cBehind each medicine that is in short supply are patients who need them for their health and wellbeing,\u201d said Ms Fitzell, who said medications in short supply this year have included certain steroid creams used to treat eczema, ADHD medication and Ozempic. \u201cMedicine availability issues have potential to impact medical conditions and can create considerable stress and inconvenience to patients,\u201d she said. Back in 2018, the IPU says, pharmacists were spending between five and 10 hours a month dealing with supply shortages. That has now jumped to 20 hours a month. \u201cPharmacists are highly experienced and work with prescribers to source alternatives where required,\u201d Ms Fitzell said. \u201cHowever, this process is often time consuming for healthcare providers and takes too long for patients. \u201cThis is a global problem and therefore we must look at what Ireland can control and implement this rapidly.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

Aviva Insurance Ireland\u2019s combined operating ratio (COR) \u2013 the cost of claims and administration relative to premiums earned \u2013 fell to 94.4 per cent for the reporting quarter from 105.5 per cent for the same period last year, according to a trading statement from its UK parent on Thursday.

The wider group - also spanning its UK and Canadian businesses - also swung into writing business at a profit in the first quarter. Performance \"UK, Ireland and Canada COR improved sharply to 90.6 per cent from 118.7 per cent owing to better underwriting performance, benign weather experience, a reduction in Covid-19 related claims compared to the prior year and frequency benefits in motor lines from continuing lockdowns,\" it said. \u201cWhile the significant decline in motor rates seen over the last 12 months combined with increasing claims frequency as lockdown restrictions are lifted will have an impact on COR going forward we still expect our full year COR to be below 95 per cent.\u201d Aviva\u2019s Irish personal lines of insurance premiums, including motor and home business, declined by 7 per cent to \u00a353 million (\u20ac61.4 million) on the year, though its commercial premiums rose by 12 per cent to \u00a357 million, according to the statement.

            "raw_text": "The Central Bank plans to ban the widespread practice of motor and home insurers increasing premiums for loyal customers by stealth. However, it stopped short of following the UK in effectively prohibiting providers offering below-cost discounts to lure new customers. The regulator said on Wednesday that it is proposing to ban so-called \u201cprice walking\u201d, where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurer. Premium This means that insurers cannot charge personal consumers who are on their second or subsequent renewal a premium that is higher than what they would have charged them if they were on their first renewal. It estimates customers who stay with the same car insurer for nine years or more are paying 14 per cent more than a driver with a similar risk profile renewing for the first time. The disparity is even starker in home insurance, where the difference averages 32 per cent. Central Bank officials were not able to provide overall monetary estimates of how much Irish households could expect to save in a given year from its proposal, which is subject to a public consultation process running until October 22nd. The measures, which the bank would be able to bring into force under its own powers, are expected to apply from July 2022, almost three years after the regulator decided to look into the issue of differential pricing in insurance. The UK Financial Conduct Authority moved in May to proceed with a de facto ban on dual pricing in the home and motor markets. While it has said that insurers are free to set new business prices, they cannot charge an existing customer looking to renew their policy more than the equivalent new business price. Dual pricing The bank's proposals do not go as far as the commitment from Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party in their programme for government last year to work on removing dual pricing from the insurance market. However, the Department of Finance said it believes that the Central Bank proposal is \u201cin line\u201d with the Government\u2019s insurance action plan. Minister of State for Insurance Se\u00e1n Fleming said it \u201cwas important to allow the detailed technical work be completed\u201d and that any regulatory changes need to reflect \u201cthe specific circumstances in the Irish market, which is different to other larger markets\u201d. Gr\u00e1inne McEvoy, director of consumer protection at the regulator, defended the organisation\u2019s stance, saying it is \u201cbalanced and proportionate\u201d and \u201creflective of the Irish market\u201d. She said the planned rules will still encourage consumers to \u201cshop around\u201d and help foster competition in the market. \"There is a need to avoid unintended consequences,\" said Derville Rowland, director general for financial conduct at the Central Bank. \"We don't want the ban to prevent a balanced approach where discounts available to new customers are eradicated.\" However, she said that charging loyal customers a \u201cloyalty premium\u201d has \u201cno place\u201d in the market. Ms Rowland insisted that the timeline of the Central Bank review and the plan to introduce the changes 12 months from now was the \u201cfastest possible\u201d pace at which the regulator could act. \"We are in the leading group in Europe to have moved on this,\" she said. \"It is absolutely essential that we analyse our market to see what are the prevailing characteristics, the prevalence of the features, and impacts on various customer groups. And it is also very important that when you intervene like this, that you get it right.\" Records For the review, the Central Bank said it captured 90 per cent of the car and motor markets as it collected 11 million policy records, spanning three years .  It also carried out a survey of about 5,500 consumers. It estimated the extent to which loyal customers are paying over the odds for coverage by comparing actual premiums against a \u201ctechnical premium\u201d, which is an insurer\u2019s view of the cost of pricing the policy. Where new motor customers typically benefit from a 2 per cent discount to the technical premium, someone who has been with an insurer for at least nine years is charged, on average, 25 per cent more than the break-even threshold. The bank said it is proposing that motor and home insurers review their pricing policies and processes annually. It also plans to a make insurers secure the consent of customers in cases where policies are automatically renewed. It is also considering additional measures in relation to complaints resolution, transparency and dealing with vulnerable customers as part of an upcoming review of its general consumer protection code.",

In general, there is no doubt that cohabiting couples can lose out both financially and in terms of their rights when it comes to inheritance/asset splits etc. \u201cI think for people [cohabiting couples] with wealth of a degree, that they would want to pass it to each other, in terms of a death, then you\u2019re leaving yourself in quite a difficult position,\u201d says Mairead Harbron, a partner with PwC Private. Harbron says that from a pure  tax  perspective, marriage \u201cabsolutely makes sense, as without those valuable spousal exemptions, you\u2019re quite limited in terms of sheltering your exposure\u201d. But should this be the case? \u201cIt does raise the question as to whether or not current tax legislation is fit for purpose,\u201d Harbron says, adding that while you cannot have \u201cexemptions or reliefs for everything\u201d, she suggests that the current regime does warrant more consideration. Change \u2013 albeit of a limited nature \u2013 could be on the way following  a court ruling on eligibility  to the widow\u2019s/widower\u2019s pension earlier this year. Income tax There are no specific benefits to being in an unmarried relationship from a tax perspective, as both parties will be treated as single people for income tax purposes. This means that if unmarried, you will lose out on standard rate band extensions, which allow a couple to earn a greater amount of income at the 20 per cent tax rate. Unmarried couples also lose out on other initiatives, such as the home carer tax credit, as to avail of this, you must be married and be jointly assessed for income tax. For Harbron, this restriction of the home carer tax credit to married couples may now be seen as a bit of an anachronism. \u201cIt is unusual that it should only apply to a married couple, as it relates to taking care of someone who is dependent,\u201d Harbron says. Unmarried couples also do not benefit from the spousal exemption, which allows the tax-free transfer of assets between couples, be it capital gains tax (CGT) or capital acquisitions tax (CAT), both levied at a rate of 33 per cent. However, there may be ways of avoiding CGT/CAT on transfers of assets between partners, as courts can make three orders for qualified cohabitants, in relation to maintenance payments, property adjustment orders and  pension  adjustment orders. To be deemed as a qualified cohabitant, you must have been in relationship for at least two years, either same sex or opposite sex, where you and your partner are parents of one or more dependent children. Or, five years in all other cases. The relationship must have been ended by death or separation, and neither person may have been married to, or living with, another person in four of the five years before the relationship ended. However, to avail of such reliefs that automatically apply in a marriage, cohabitants have to go down a legal route. And if making a claim, you will have to show you are financially dependent on the other partner. Pensions If you are unmarried, you might lose out on any spousal benefits, such as a spousal payout on an annuity, or the transfer of a pension to a spouse in the event of the death of a partner. And tax issues may arise on any pension benefits that are transferred. When it comes to welfare payments, until recently, you would not have entitlement to claim a widow\u2019s/widower\u2019s or surviving civil partner\u2019s pension. Moreover, cohabitants are not eligible for the widowed or surviving civil partner grant, a once-off payment worth \u20ac8,000 to surviving spouses with dependent children. However, change is afoot, at least on this front. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court found the relevant social welfare legislation, which excluded unmarried partners from claiming the widow\u2019s/widower\u2019s pension, upon the death of one, unconstitutional. Sin\u00e9ad Lacey of the Free Legal Advice Centre acted for Joe O\u2019Meara, who took the case following the death of his partner Michelle Batey. Now the  Department of Social Protection  and the Office of the Attorney General are working on amending legislation. According to a spokeswoman for the department, \u201cthis is being done with all expediency\u201d. Once in place, it will means that entitlement to the benefit is likely to be on similar qualification grounds as other welfare benefits paid to cohabitants. But does it mean that other ways in which married and unmarried couples are treated may change? Lacey does not think so, pointing to the specifics in this case. \u201cOne of the aspects of this, is that for most payments under the social welfare code, you don\u2019t have to be married to qualify,\u201d Lacey says. This meant that the payment was a bit of an outlier. Another aspect of the case, she says, is that children were involved. They qualified for an uplift in the widow\u2019s/widower\u2019s payment \u2013 but were being excluded on the basis that their parents were not married. \u201cIt was more about the children being denied access to support,\u201d Lacey says, adding that \u201cthat particular idea of discrimination against non-marital children is anathema at this stage.\u201d However, it may change things over time. \u201cIt does potentially loosen up the case law, and allows for a space in which someone else might litigate,\u201d she says. Death It is often accepted that if you are not married, then you will have to bear the full brunt of inheritance tax should your partner die. This can be a significant burden, as if you are not married, your partner will be treated as a \u201cstranger\u201d under inheritance tax law. This means that they will have a tax-free allowance of \u20ac16,250 (it has increased by just \u20ac1,175 since 2015). \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot,\u201d says Harbron. Once the tax-free allowance is deduced, tax at a rate of 33 per cent will have to be paid on the rest of the estate. For example, leaving a house or estate worth \u20ac350,000 would result in a tax bill of more than \u20ac100,000. But this is not always the case. First of all, you might jointly own your house. In such cases, whereby items were jointly owned, these will automatically pass to the surviving cohabitant and will not form part of the deceased\u2019s estate. As this passes outside the estate, no CGT will be due \u2013 but CAT might apply. Furthermore, unmarried couples may be able to avail of the dwelling house exemption to transfer a principal private residence free of tax. However, this is quite restrictive, as it was not introduced to facilitate cohabiting couples. According to Harbron, you must fulfil a number of requirements to avail of the exemption. These include: the property has to be the main home of the person who died; the person who is inheriting it has to have lived in the house as their main residence for three years immediate to the death; and the person inheriting must not have an interest in another house. In addition, the surviving partner has to continue and live in the house for a subsequent six years \u2013 otherwise there will be a clawback of relief. While you can sell the house, and reinvest the proceeds in a new home, you must reinvest the full amount. As Harbron points out, if you sell a house for \u20ac500,000, and reinvest \u20ac400,000 in a new home, then there will be clawback on the \u20ac100,000 difference. There could be scope for a better system of tax relief for unmarried couples, Harbron says. \u201cI absolutely think there should be something there for long-term cohabitants.\u201d You may also face a tax bill on a life insurance policy. If, for example, one partner\u2019s life is insured for \u20ac300,000, the other partner will face a tax bill of 33 per cent, or some \u20ac99,000, on it. However, according to broker Nick McGowan of  Lion.ie , a work around for this is to take out two \u201clife of another\u201d policies \u2013 that is, you pay to insure your partner\u2019s life. \u201cIf they do so, the surviving partner will receive any pay out tax free because they are the beneficial owner of the policy,\u201d says McGowan. It may cost more to take out single life policies, compared to one joint policy, but it could lead to hefty tax savings. Another issue that can arise is when it comes to your right to inherit. If you have a will, this can protect the rights to inherit of the surviving partner, as otherwise, the surviving partner has no automatic right to a share in the deceased partner\u2019s estate. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to have a will,\u201d says Harbron, adding that for unmarried couples, \u201cwithout a will there is no provision under the Succession Act\u201d. So, you might need to get a court order to protect your interest. Otherwise, the estate of the person who died might go to their children, if they have them. If not, it could go to their brothers and sisters, says Harbron, and after this, their parents.

            "raw_text": "The Central Bank\u2019s annual motor insurance market report, the second installment of which was published this week, shows insurers made a total of \u20ac142 million of operating profits last year from motor coverage in the Republic. It also highlights that overall cost of claims per motor policy between 2009 and 2019 fell by 9 per cent, while the average insurance premium rose 35 per cent. This tells us nothing of the roller coast ride in the meantime, fuelling the Irish motor insurance industry\u2019s boom-bust nature \u2013 with painful costs for drivers. The industry\u2019s historically shocking inability to price risk meant premiums were way too low a decade ago. Quinn Insurance\u2019s implosion in 2010 was testament to that. So too were RSA Insurance Ireland\u2019s need for a bailout from its UK parent a few years later and FBD\u2019s requirement for a rescue investment from a Canadian financial group in 2015. The average Irish motor premium rose by 66 per cent from a low point in late 2013 to a peak of \u20ac714 in mid-2018 before dropping 9 per cent in late 2019. The profits generated by insurers last year were strong by any standards. This has rightly added to criticism that insurers have been seeking to recoup heavy motor losses around the middle of the last decade by making above-average returns in recent times. The report has also found that injury claims of less than \u20ac100,000 that went down the legal route resulted in only a marginal financial benefit for injured parties in recent years compared to going through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). However, the average \u20ac15,000 legal bill associated with such litigated cases (totalling \u20ac247 million over five years) was a multiple of the \u20ac500 legal expenses attached to typical PIAB cases. The cost is ultimately borne by motorists. The new Judicial Council is set to issue guidelines for personal injuries court awards next year. It's hoped that this will lead to lower court payouts. But there's also an urgent need to find a way to make it more difficult for individuals making personal injury claims to avoid the PIAB process.",

Joe Brennan reports. Air travel\u2019s rebound rather than economic growth boosted Irish   greenhouse gas emissions  late last year, according to EU statisticians. That contradicts the Government\u2019s own claim that its high GDP growth last year was responsible for Ireland being one of the few EU members to increase emissions at the end of last year.

Barry also reports that regulators say they are aware of challenges faced by   waste-to-energy plants  required to turn down electricity generation when other power sources are available to the grid. A body representing Indaver in Duleek, Co Meath and Dublin Waste-to-Energy, says the Irish market loses enough electricity to supply 1,000 homes a year because they are prevented from generating power all the time.

Within hours we got another mail from a reader called Diarmuid telling a story that had a very different ending. \u201cWe recently received a renewal quote for our house insurance,\u201d he says. The company offering the insurance was Zurich but the quote was \u201cprocured by a brokerage that we have used over the last number of years. The quote was circa \u20ac680 and included a \u20ac60 broker fee. We received the usual statement of suitability from the brokers and were informed that they had checked out \u2018\u2026 our panel of providers \u2026' and assured us that Zurich were the most suitable. \u201cI was a bit uncomfortable with the \u20ac60 broker fee, being mindful that the broker is already receiving substantial commission from Zurich for the policy itself. As such I contacted Zurich myself and obtained a quote from them for just over \u20ac400 \u2013 a saving of over \u20ac300 and almost a 50 per cent discount.\u201d [\u00a0 The high price of bad financial advice: \u2018Be very, very careful where you get your information\u2019 \u00a0] He says he was \u201csomewhat amazed at the price change and also the behaviour of the broker. Perhaps there is something missing in our policy and that the policy proposed by the broker was far superior, but I do wonder, and particularly in circumstances where we used the rebuild calculator and ensured that all was covered. At this stage I am contemplating a complaint about the broker, but sure time will tell if I have the energy!\u201d",

            "raw_text": "This year\u2019s historic Liffey swim, which is over 100 years old, is under threat over an insurance issue and ongoing dispute within swimming. The annual race, one of Ireland\u2019s most famous traditional sporting events, is currently uninsured, with organisers claiming it, along with other sea swimming events, cannot proceed until the matter is resolved. Open water swimming is an Olympic event and has been part of the Olympic roster since the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. The Liffey race is managed by a voluntary not-for-profit organisation, Leinster Open Sea (LOS), who organise the sea swimming events throughout the summer and are affiliated to Swim Ireland.

A letter from LOS dated May 9th, 2023 and sent out to clubs ahead of a meeting with Swim Ireland, to which LOS say it was not invited, highlights the insurance issue. \u201cWith only three weeks to go to the start of the sea race season, Swim Ireland are refusing to affiliate Leinster Open Sea and are seeking over 70 amendments to Leinster Open Sea\u2019s constitution which was submitted and accepted by Swim Ireland in 2020. \u201cSwim Ireland have stated they will not provide insurance cover for races run by or in conjunction with Leinster Open Sea unless Leinster Open Sea complies with Swim Ireland\u2019s full demands without compromise.\u201d [\u00a0 Liffey Swim 2022: In pictures \u00a0] The swim in the Liffey is one of the last in a season of 30 events around the coast. The 100th race took place in 2019, starting at the Guinness Brewery and finishing at North Wall Quay in front of the Custom House. The only year it did not take place was in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first swim took place in July 1920 with 28 male swimmers competing before Jack B Yeats famously captured the event in his 1923 painting \u201cThe Liffey Swim\u201d. The piece won Yeats the silver medal for painting at the art competition in the 1924 Summer Olympic Games and is now in the National Gallery. An annual women\u2019s race on the course under the Liffey bridges was not introduced until 1991 and has been held since then as a separate race as part of the Liffey Swim programme. But for many years before, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid opposed the idea of women racing. In the letter LOS ask Swim Ireland to wait until this sea race season is over, when both bodies can then have negotiations with an independent mediator to resolve this dispute. Furthermore, it asks Swim Ireland \u201cto continue to provide insurance cover for the races run by and in conjunction with Leinster Open Sea swims in the 2023 season.\u201d In response Swim Ireland issued a short statement. \u201cSwim Ireland are currently looking at internal structures around Open Water Swimming including governance, health and safety, processes and the wants from our clubs,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are in the process of speaking to all relevant and interested parties and it is our intention that the 2023 Liffey Swim will go ahead.\u201d The 100th edition of the event held in 2019 had the highest number of men finishing, 364 and the highest number of women finishing, 252. The youngest ever male winner of the Liffey Swim, Francis \u201cChalkey\u201d White, a well-known figure in Irish swimming circles, won the race in 1966 at age 11. A number of Irish Olympians have also won the race including Donnacha O\u2019Dea (1963, 1965), who competed in the Mexico City Olympics in 1968. Kevin Williamson, who swam in freestyle events in Montreal in 1976 and Moscow four years later was a winner in 2000.",

            "raw_text": "Two more cases have been brought before the Commercial Court over a refusal by an insurance company to provide an indemnity for business interruption insurance due to the pandemic. Charlie's Bar, Loughrea, Co Galway, operated by Charwin Ltd, and the Old Imperial Hotel in Youghal,Co Cork, operated by Coachhouse Catering Ltd, have brought separate claims against Slovenia-based Zavarovalnica Sava insurance company. The Old Imperial's company is also suing its Irish broker, Frost Insurance , trading as Frost Underwriting UQuote. On Monday, Mr Justice David Barniville adjourned both cases to June for a hearing on an arbitration clause in the policies which the insurance company has invoked. Charwin claims it is entitled to an indemnity under the policy for interruption/losses after March 15th last year when the first lockdown was announced. It also seeks a declaration the closure order from that date constituted a loss and/or destruction and/damage to the property it uses for business. Charwin director Brian Winters said in an affidavit that Charlie's employs 17, three full-time and 14 part-time staff in what had been a traditional \"wet pub\" (does not serve food). In an effort to mitigate losses, Mr Winters said they carried out significant work on the premises to provide substantial meals.

In the Old Imperial Hotel action, it claims it is entitled to be indemnified under its contract of insurance which ran from February 2020 to February of this year. It also seeks damages for alleged breach of contract, including aggravated and/or exemplary damages. Dan Leahy, a director and manager of Coachhouse Catering, said in an affidavit the defendants appeared, in declining the indemnity, to be making the case the cover was for interruption to business as a result of damage to the insured premises. His advice is that the meaning of \u201cdamage\u201d in the policy is not clearly defined and Covid-19 has not been excluded from the policy. This ambiguity, he was advised, should be interpreted in favour of the insured, he said.",

            "raw_text": "Interesting times ahead for FD Technologies, the company run by Seamus Keating, which has seen a number of curious names pop up on the company\u2019s share register in recent times. One of those is Irenic Capital Management, a New York activist investor which just this week pushed its stake in FD to 14 per cent, the latest in a series of acquisitions over the course of the last few months. Irenic now holds \u00a349.7 million (\u20ac57.81 million) on FD shares but it is less the size of its stake than the nature of its strategy that is most interesting. The fund, founded by Adam Katz and Andy Dodge, is an activist fund, meaning it takes positions in companies in order to use its shares and voting power \u2013 and often its public platform \u2013 to encourage management teams to make changes in the way they run their businesses. It has not been shy about doing precisely that in recent years, publicly opposing gas producer Capricorn Energy\u2019s plan to sell itself to an Israeli energy group; calling on Wagamama boss Ken Hanna to step down; advocating for the appointment of its own board members to aerospace company Barnes Group; and once voicing its opposition to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s plans to merge Fox and NewsCorp. In that context, another curious name has appeared on the FD share register in recent days, that of Newtyn Management, LLC, a New York-based investment fund that has bought up 5.1 per cent of the shares, worth \u00a318.1 million (\u20ac21 million). Newtyn is not an activist investor, according to its website, but it has popped up on the share registers of companies where Irenic was being most voluble in its activist positions. They joined the shareholder rebellion against Capricorn Energy\u2019s sale of itself and they were on the share register when Irenic called for Hanna to step down from the board of the company behind Wagamama\u2019s parent company The Restaurant Group. Newtyn also had a stake in Theravance Biopharma at the same time as Irenic, during which time Irenic nominated one of its advisers to the company\u2019s board. All of which could be a great coincidence. Wall Street is a small place, after all, and investors frequently cross paths on various share registers \u2013 especially since we don\u2019t have any clarity yet on Irenic\u2019s intentions. Activist investors traditionally agitate for changes in business strategy or for the break-up of companies to release value, two things that FD is already doing. The company is in the midst of a big restructuring which involves splitting itself into three. It has already begun the merging of its marketing division, MRP, with an American firm called Contentgine to create a joint-venture entity in which FD will hold 49 per cent. And it is running the rule over the sale of its technology and consulting arm, KX, though that will take a little while, it warned, noting in one stock market announcement that it will \u201ctake a measured approach\u201d. This might explain Newtyn\u2019s interest. On its website it describes itself as a \u201cvalue-oriented investment firm\u201d which aims to \u201ccapitalise on special opportunities that may arise from a corporate restructuring, bankruptcy or liquidation, proposed merger, acquisition or divestiture, or a new public offering\u201d. Either way, interesting times ahead for FD Technologies.

            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2024-04-15",
            "raw_text": "Ah don\u2019t tell me the old VHI Plan B is retiring? Ah don\u2019t tell me the old VHI Plan B is retiring? It is indeed. After decades as the workhorse of Irish health insurance, the plan many people would have grown up with will vanish from May 1st. It is worth noting, mind you, that it hasn\u2019t been called Plan B for donkey\u2019s years and the plans that are being retired are actually known as Health Plus Extra, Health Plus Access, Health Plus Excess and Health Access. Will many people be impacted? Will many people be impacted? According to the Health Insurance Authority, the move will impact about 130,000 people representing one in 10 of the VHI\u2019s customer base. Many will be older and will have continuously renewed their cover out of a sense of (misplaced) loyalty or inertia or a desire to retain full cover for major orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures. What do you mean by  misplaced  loyalty? What do you mean by loyalty? misplaced The reality is that anyone who doesn\u2019t shop around for better value health insurance every three years or so is paying over the odds. This was particularly true of the Health Plus plans which were considered by insurance experts to be expensive and getting more expensive all the time. [\u00a0 About 130,000 people affected as VHI scraps some of its most popular plans \u00a0] Health Plus Extra was priced at \u20ac2,951 per adult in April 2023 climbing to \u20ac3,169 last October and to \u20ac3,400 last month. That is a cumulative increase of \u20ac449 in less than a year A retired couple who decided to renew on the Health Plus Extra scheme from March 2024 would have to pay almost \u20ac900 extra to cover the cost. So now that they are gone, what do I need to do? So now that they are gone, what do I need to do? An alternative will be offered by the VHI to those affected but people should take the opportunity to get the best value and resist the urge to auto-renew on whatever is offered. What should I be looking at? What should I be looking at? There are alternatives available from VHI such as their Advanced Care product range but, according to Dermott Goode of  totalhealthcover.ie , \u201cmembers need to be careful that they aren\u2019t transferred to more expensive options\u201d. For example, those on Health Plus Extra could consider the VHI Advanced Care Extra scheme at \u20ac3,327 \u2013 just over \u20ac70 less than the plan they are on now \u2013 but the outpatient cover is not as generous. They will likely be offered the Advanced Care Extra Day-to-Day scheme but this will increase their cost further to \u20ac3,543 per adult. That doesn\u2019t sound great That doesn\u2019t sound great No, but there are other options for Health Plus Extra members that offer \u201cexceptional cover for approximately \u20ac2,400 per adult versus \u20ac3,400 on Health Plus Extra\u201d,  Goode says. And for those on Health Access or Health Plus Excess, they may be able to save up to \u20ac400 per adult by shopping around across the market . The auto-enrolment pension scheme seems good on paper, but how will it actually work? But shopping around is confusing, right? But shopping around is confusing, right? It can seem that way. There are about 350 plans on the market and people are understandably fearful of making the wrong choices when it comes to something as important as their health. The good news is there are rules in place that give consumers protection irrespective of their age or their health issues. [\u00a0 Health insurer VHI records \u20ac43.4m loss as cost of claims rises by 18% \u00a0] What kind of rules? What kind of rules? For starters, you do not lose the cover you already have by moving from one company to another. If the plan on the table from Company B offers enhanced cover compared to the cover you had from Company A, you will most likely have to wait for that to kick in, but whatever cover you had already, you keep. And I can\u2019t be penalised for a pre-existing condition? And I can\u2019t be penalised for a pre-existing condition? No and we can\u2019t stress that enough. Unlike with other forms of insurance, you cannot be penalised financially because of your health or age. When it comes to health insurance, everyone is considered equal in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of the providers. So, how do I go about making the right choice? So, how do I go about making the right choice? The first thing you need to do is arm yourself with some facts. Call your current provider to see whether they have a lower-cost equivalent plan to the one you are currently on. If you are happy to take on some minor reductions, depending on the savings, let them know that too. They will already have a complete record of all previous claims you have made, so the simplest question to ask is whether any new and cheaper plans would have covered all the claims that have been paid out over the last two years and to the same level. If you are talking to a different provider, be upfront, bearing in mind you will not be penalised for honesty. [\u00a0 Price hikes from VHI will see some families worse off by \u20ac500 this year \u00a0] Detail all the important elements of your existing policy, and outline any underlying conditions and procedures carried out. Have them confirm that any new and cheaper plan will cover everything you have had covered in the past. And should I do it all online? And should I do it all online? No. When it comes to health insurance, it is much better to do it over the phone. Providers like it when we shop online, but by doing so we become responsible for all the decisions, be they good or bad. By talking to a company representative and asking the right questions, and insisting on having everything explained \u2013 and don\u2019t feel bad about asking questions \u2013 you put the onus on them to make everything clear. Remember, calls will be recorded \u201cfor training and quality purposes\u201d, so they can\u2019t take you down the garden path over what is actually said.

            "raw_text": "A large part of the responsibility for the insurance crisis is due to \"excessive profit-taking on the part of insurance companies,\" the Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan has said. He was speaking in the Four Courts at a ceremony where he signed an order bringing into being the Judicial Council, a body first recommended by an Oireachtas committee 20 years ago. The council, which comprises all of the State\u2019s judges, will be responsible for handling complaints against judges, producing sentencing guidelines, judicial education and training, as well as the production of guidelines on personal injury awards. Insurance companies have claimed that high personal injury awards are a major factor in the rise in insurance premiums. However, Mr Flanagan said: \u201cA large part of the problem is excessive profit-taking on the part of insurance companies.\u201d A new committee of the Judicial Council that is to produce guidelines on personal injury awards would, he had no doubt, allow the courts achieve a greater level of consistency in terms of personal injury awards. But what was happening in the courts was only one part of the \u201cjigsaw\u201d, he said. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Mr Flanagan called on the insurance sector to \u201cact swiftly\u201d in response to the establishment of the Judicial Council. \u201cThe insurance industry itself has got to give a lead here. Much of the public debate has been surrounding what has been described as a compensation culture. I would have to say a response to what is a challenging issue must be more than just dealt with by the courts.\u201d There was evidence the insurance companies were making \u201csubstantial and handsome profits\u201d, he said. The insurance industry had been very quick to cite fraud and exaggerated claims as being a factor behind high insurance premiums, he added. \u201c I wouldn\u2019t like to exaggerate those instances in terms of court cases and court hearings.\u201d If the insurance companies had evidence of such cases they should hand the evidence over to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. Mr Flanagan described the establishment of the Judicial Council as a \u201clandmark moment in the history of our State.\u201d The Chief Justice Frank Clarke said the first meeting of the council is expected to take place in February and will formally establish the council's various committees. The personal injuries guidelines committee has already been established on an informal basis. \u201cIt is worth commenting at this stage that the first meeting of this committee designate of judges occurred on December 2nd, which is eight full months ahead of the mandatory deadline set out in the act for the meeting of the formal committee,\u201d he said. The overriding function of the council was to promote and maintain public confidence in the judiciary and the administration of justice, he added. Aligned with the public perception of independence of the courts was a requirement that judges were seen to uphold the highest standards of judicial conduct. Ethics, impartiality, codes of conduct, and a means to file complaints were all part of the the council\u2019s upcoming role, as well as judicial education and support, and producing sentencing guidelines. The signing of the order took place in the offices of the Chief Justice, at a table that was used by the three-judge Supreme Court set up in 1924 at the time of the Free State. Among those present were the Mr Justice George Birmingham, Mr Justice Peter Kelly, Judge Patricia Ryan, and Judge Colin Daly, presidents respectively of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court, and the District Court, as well as the Attorney General, Seamus Woulfe SC.",

Differential pricing, dual pricing or price walking \u2013 it has different names \u2013 occurs when customers with similar risk profiles are charged different premiums. Insurers in the car and home insurance sectors have for some time been hiking up the prices for longstanding customers in the hope they won\u2019t notice or be bothered to change provider while simultaneously offering new and prospective customers discounted or lower rates. The fact that this odious practice of effectively penalising loyalty was a regular if not widespread practice here couldn\u2019t have come as much of a surprise to consumers. It was operating in plain sight. Why the regulator, the consumer\u2019s chief guardian, has taken so long to get around to cracking down on it is another matter. It only appears to have looked into it on foot of a similar probe in the UK. Taking \u2018advantage\u2019 Nonetheless, it is now moving to stamp it out. In an address to the Compliance Institute, the Central Bank's director of financial regulation Gerry Cross said the regulator would be sticking to its plan of introducing a ban from July of this year despite requests for a six- to nine-month lead-in period. Such behaviour took \"undue advantage of customers' behaviours\" and was unacceptable and there was an urgent need for it to be tackled, he said. \u201cCounter to what might be the legitimate expectation of a customer that by proving themselves to be a good customer, a loyal customer, their premiums would reduce taking due account of their overall riskiness, in fact the reverse has been happening,\u201d Mr Cross said. \u201cInsurers have noted this loyalty and taken covert advantage of it to charge the customer more on renewal.\u201d This is a welcome move by the regulator but consumers should still take a leaf our Minister of State Sean Fleming\u2019s book by shopping around for a better price each year.",

            "raw_text": "A man has avoided a jail term for attempted fraud after he and his sister falsely claimed that an elderly motorist reversed into their vehicle. Edward Maguire (45) of Cabra Park, Dublin 7 and Suzanne Maguire (37) of Sillogue, Ballymun, both pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to attempting to induce Axa Insurance to pay out on the foot of a false claim with the intention of making a gain for themselves or causing a loss to another on September 22nd 2017. The alleged road traffic accident happened in a car park outside a convenience store on Glasnevin Avenue, in Dublin. Garda Sean Burke told Antonia Boyle BL, prosecuting, at a previous sentence hearing last February that Suzanne Maguire was sitting in her brother\u2019s car when an elderly man hit a plastic bollard while he was reversing his vehicle out of a parking space. Maguire got out of the car and approached the driver claiming that he had hit her brother\u2019s vehicle and caused damage. She also claimed that she spilled hot coffee over herself as a result of the impact. She took a photograph of the man\u2019s car and his insurance disc. Edward Maguire later followed through on the allegation by attempting to lodge a claim with Axa Insurance. He also claimed that he was in the vehicle at the time and had pain in his shoulder, while his sister had blisters on her leg from the coffee having been spilled. The insurance company investigated the claim and secured CCTV footage proving that there was no impact between the cars and that Edward Maguire was not in the vehicle at the time. Axa didn\u2019t process the claim and the garda\u00ed\u00ad were alerted. The pair were arrested and interviewed by garda\u00ed. Previous convictions Edward Maguire has 24 previous convictions including breach of a barring order, road traffic, larceny, trespass, theft and threats to kill. He has no previous convictions from the Circuit Court. Suzanne Maguire\u2019s case was adjourned to October 11th next, to allow her time to complete a drug rehabilitation course after it was accepted that she has been making progress with her addiction. She was remanded on continuing bail until that date. On Monday Judge Pauline Codd said that Suzanne Maguire had initiated contact with the elderly motorist at the scene. She said she was only giving the woman an opportunity to continue addressing her drug addiction and said she was making \u201cno guarantees\u201d. She sentenced Edward Maguire to two years in prison, which she suspended in full on strict conditions including that he engage with the Probation Service for two years. Judge Codd said it was fortunate that the incident had been covered by CCTV footage. She accepted that the offence was opportunistic but said Edward Maguire had followed through on the claim before she described it as \u201ca nasty offence on an elderly man\u201d. She said that the other driver had been put through a certain degree of stress and noted that Suzanne Maguire had taken a photograph of his car and insurance disc. Judge Codd said Edward Maguire had been \u201chappy to carry on the baton\u201d and said he had \u201cstuck to his story\u201d during his interview with the garda\u00ed. She acknowledged that Axa did not process the claim and that the pair had not gained from it. Judge Codd said she had taken into account Edward Maguire\u2019s plea of guilty and the fact that the \u201centire plan had many holes it\u201d. She noted he was in collusion with his sister, that he has since made progress with his addiction issues, has a long-standing history of depression and has not come to garda attention since.",

The news comes as Grace Donnelan reports on a   Tipperary water park  that fears it will be unable to reopen due to difficulty in renewing public liability insurance amid escalating premiums.  One of the largest outstanding tax disputes in the State has moved closer to settlement, with the money at issue falling dramatically. Following discussions between consumer health group Perrigo and Ireland's Revenue Commissioners, the Irish tax authorities have now accepted that the contested sum is actually less than \u20ac1 billion. Dominic Coyle spoke to the company's chief executive Murray Kessler about the issue.  Kilkenny-based Modubuild  is seeking to take revenues over the next three years to more than \u20ac100 million and may take on outside investment for the first time as it looks to fuel growth. Chief executive and co-founder Kevin Brennan told Charlie Taylor the company expects to record revenues of at least \u20ac48 million this year, with \u20ac35 million of this already secured. Charlie also reports on   Junk Kouture , a platform that showcases work from post-primary school students making create designs using recycled materials, which has secured $1 million in seed funding. Specialist construction business   Pure Fitout will spend \u20ac1.2 million hiring apprentices  over the next five years to aid it in meeting demand, reports Barry O'Halloran.

            "raw_text": "Travel insurance relating to the 15 countries named on the Government\u2019s newly published \u201cgreen list\u201d will now operate as normal, the industry confirmed on Thursday. Following some confusion the lobby group Insurance Ireland said the main providers of cover would now operate subject to normal terms and conditions. In a statement it said that as the Department of Foreign Affairs had updated its travel advisory for the named countries from \u201cessential travel only\u201d to \u201cnormal precautions\u201d, regular services could resume. \u201cConsumers should check directly with their insurer, and should also be aware that the green list will be reviewed on a fortnightly basis and is subject to change,\u201d it said. Earlier this week insurers had sought clarity on official advice regarding overseas travel to the so-called green list countries. Until Tuesday the Department of Foreign Affairs had a blanket advisory warning against non-essential travel outside of Ireland \u2013 anyone who disregarded that would automatically void their insurance cover. With the publication of the green list the status of those countries was changed to \u201cgeneral precautions\u201d, prompting the change in position from providers. However, the Government is still urging the public to avoid foreign holidays this year based on public health advice. Malta, Finland, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Slovakia, Greece, Greenland, Gibraltar, Monaco and San Marino have been included on the green list. The development was quickly welcomed by insurer Multitrip. com, which said holidaymakers were now free to travel \"with peace of mind\" to those named destinations. It said it would now \u201ccover cancellation as a result of a positive Covid-19 diagnosis on their policies with immediate effect\u201d . The company said it would add this cancellation cover to existing policies and cover medical expenses abroad resulting from Covid-19 illness. Diagnosis While it is as yet unclear what other providers will do, Mulittrip said its policy could now cover cases affected where a traveller, their companion or any person they had arranged to stay with had received a diagnosis. \"We are delighted that the Government/Department of Foreign Affairs has changed their advice following pressure from the insurance industry and have given clarity,\" said managing director Ciaran Mulligan. \u201cIrish holidaymakers can now travel with peace of mind knowing that they are covered by their travel insurance if they travel to the countries on the green list. We would also call on the Government to review regions as well as countries when they are updating their list in the next two weeks.\u201d",

            "author": "Barry McCall",
            "date": "2020-03-26",
            "raw_text": "Ireland may be home to the European HQs of all of the digital giants but when it comes to innovation in insurance products and service delivery we tend to lag behind our international peers. \"Ireland is behind the curve when it comes to innovation in insurance,\" says Naoise Harnett, a partner with law firm Pinsent Masons. \"Asia is the leading geography in terms of insurance innovation. The UK is also a leading jurisdiction followed by a few European markets such as Germany.\" He says there are a number of reasons why Ireland is lagging behind in terms of insurance innovation. \u201cOne of them is that a number of the international companies based in Ireland do not have the mandate or budget for large-scale innovation projects,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnother reason is that the domestic insurance market is very small, so it is very difficult to scale an insuretech business in here.\u201d There are, however, a number of business lines offered in Ireland where innovation is visible, such as motor, home, life and health. \u201cMost innovations in the Irish market are about strengthening existing products and services to strengthen customer relationships rather than the roll-out of new business models based on technological innovation,\u201d says Harnett. Richard O\u2019Dwyer, managing director of Hiscox Ireland, agrees with this assessment. \u201cRight now, I think in general insurance terms, Ireland is lagging behind many other countries,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a question of scale and diversity of business that means it will generally be more difficult in this country. When I look to other parts of our global businesses, the scale of the opportunities in the UK, Germany, France and USA give those businesses the opportunity to try new things and get a quick view on how this is performing. The key to innovation is failing fast and failing often and the size of the market here makes it difficult to try these things. The level of investment required up front makes this a challenge.\u201d Evolving risks Hiscox has introduced some innovations, however. \u201cSpeaking from our own point of view the main innovations that we have been involved in is providing covers for evolving risks such as cyber,\u201d says O\u2019Dwyer. \u201cThis is both in a business and personal capacity. What our cyberproduct does, however, is more focused on a service-based risk management and mitigation solution rather than a traditional indemnity-based insurance policy. We have recognised that what our customers need in this space is a support function to support them with IT forensics, legal support, extortion demands as well as the PR damage that can arise from a data incident.\u201d EY Financial Services head of insurance James Maher believes scale is a key factor at work in this poor overall performance. \u201cInsurance companies in Ireland are not at the leading edge of innovation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe big international companies tend to locate the capital and regulatory aspects of their business in Ireland but carry out innovation elsewhere. The Irish market is dominated by international subsidiaries and they are destined to be permanent teenagers who will never be at the centre of the universe in the larger group. They sit at the end of the queue for investment in innovation.\u201d KPMG\u2019s Brian Morrissey makes a similar point. \u201cA challenge for the level of innovation happening in Ireland is that entities here may often be subsidiaries of larger insurance groups, and we have a smaller market size, so there are scalability issues for insurers to test and adopt higher-end technologies here. We expect to see much more innovation in our market, as new initiatives are tested in larger markets.\u201d Mindset The 2019 PwC/Insurance Ireland CEO survey echoes these sentiments and suggests that the Irish insurance industry has more work to do to leverage digital and emerging technology, particularly artificial intelligence and robotics. \"Adopting new technologies takes time and resources and needs a mindset ready for change,\" says PwC insurance partner Darren O'Neill. \"The research also suggests a need for the industry to be more responsive to changing consumer purchasing habits as well to more fully leverage the benefits from automation. For example, four out of 10 (41 per cent) Irish insurance CEOs said they had no plans in terms of harnessing opportunities from humans and machines working together. \"",

            "raw_text": "A business interruption insurance policy is \u201criddled with obfuscation and confusion\u201d and should be interpreted as providing cover for Covid-19 disruption, the Commercial Court has been told. Richard Kean SC made that argument on Tuesday when opening a case by a hotel against a Slovenia-based insurer and a broker. The case has implications for several similar businesses which were closed by the pandemic, counsel said. Coachhouse Catering Ltd, which runs the Old Imperial Hotel in Youghal, Co Cork, has brought the action over what it says is the refusal of the Zavarovalnica Sava insurance company to provide an indemnity for losses suffered under a business interruption insurance policy provided by the firm. The plaintiff is also suing the Irish broker Frost Insurance, trading as Frost Underwriting UQuote. \u2018Almost lost their minds\u2019 Coachhouse claims it is entitled to an indemnity under the policy for interruption/losses after March 15th last year when the first lockdown was announced. It also claims the closure order from that date constituted a loss and/or destruction and/damage to the property it uses for business. It is claiming damages for alleged breach of contract, including aggravated and/or exemplary damages. The defendants deny the claims. Opening the case, Mr Kean said Zavarovalnica Sava is an insurer and re-insurer which made a \u20ac47.6 million net profit last year. The firm promises on its website to \u201cnever leave you alone\u201d and that it is caring and professional, he said, \u201cIt also says it gives you peace of mind but the plaintiffs have not been given peace of mind; they have almost lost their minds\u201d, counsel said. The core of Coachhouse\u2019s case is that the closure of the hotel caused loss and that the insurance policy was \u201criddled with ambiguity\u201d, he said. The defendants themselves did not know what the policy was about, he said. As a policy which is \u201criddled with obfuscation and confusion\u201d, it should be interpreted in favour of his client, counsel said. Peter Mills, an insurance expert called on behalf of Coachhouse, said the general exclusions section of the policy did not specifically exclude pandemic risk. Such a specific exclusion \u201cwould have made this litigation moot\u201d, he said. Under cross-examination, Alan Grace, a retired insurance expert on behalf of the defendants, said, before Covid, pandemics like Sars and swine flu were \u201con the horizon\u201d and some insurers chose to include them while others sought to reduce cover for them. Generally however, they did not put pandemic exclusions in the policy, he said. Asked by Mr Kean where was Covid specifically excluded in the Coachhouse policy, Mr Grace said it was not in the policy. He said the policy was not very well constructed and drafted. The case continues before Mr Justice Denis McDonald. It is being heard, both as a physical and remote hearing, through the TrialView system.",

            "raw_text": "Older drivers could save more than \u20ac1,000 on their car insurance bills by shopping around, according to a new cost comparison analysis. The research, conducted by online broker insuremycar.ie, indicates that some insurers are charging drivers aged over 70 considerably more than others. It found that drivers could typically save about \u20ac400-\u20ac500 on premiums by shopping around, rising to savings of more than \u20ac1,000 in some instances. Jonathan Hehir, managing director of the company, said over the past year insurers had taken more of an interest in older drivers, which had led to a slight decline in premiums. However, he added that many will never benefit from the savings because they do not shop around. Loyalty doesn\u2019t pay \u201cToo often, consumers, particularly older ones, believe that loyalty to a particular insurer will be reciprocated with a favourable price. However, we are always at pains to point out to anyone who\u2019ll listen: when it comes to insurance, loyalty may have been beneficial in the past, but it does not pay any more,\u201d said Mr Hehir. While some older drivers have been reluctant to shop around, Mr Hehir added that Covid lockdowns have led some cocooners to spend time researching the cost of premiums. \u201cWhat we are hearing from customers is that although they\u2019ve had to spend much more time indoors, they have wanted to put the time to good use by saving a few quid,\u201d he said.",

            "raw_text": "The Quinn Insurance administrators have detailed how they received tens of millions of euro in professional fees, after a court application by The Irish Times for private reports on the demise of the defunct company. The insurer\u2019s collapse, one of Ireland\u2019s largest insolvencies, cost taxpayers some \u20ac1 billion to pay liabilities the company could not meet. A surcharge is still imposed on all motor and home insurance policies to contribute to the cost of winding down the business. Accountants Grant Thornton received \u20ac41.5 million over 13 years, according to a fee summary provided with 23 progress reports the firm submitted to the High Court on its Quinn Insurance work. Grant Thornton partners Michael McAteer and Paul McCann were appointed joint administrators in 2010, work that continued until the High Court placed the insurer in liquidation last week. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 The Grant Thornton fees were in addition to \u20ac19.55 million in payments for legal services, in a further sign the fallout from the insurer\u2019s collapse proved to be a lucrative source of income for accountants and lawyers. GT Ireland fees include tax, company secretarial, forensics and transaction support work. \nDisbursements include fees for actuarial services, court swearing fees and payments for couriers and taxis. Also included were \u201csignificant\u201d IT disbursements for computer hardware, software and licences to progress the discovery stage of litigation against former Quinn Insurance auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n Solicitors Maples & Calder received \u20ac13.23 million and solicitors McCann FitzGerald received \u20ac6.35 million, inclusive in both cases of counsels\u2019 fees for barristers. The legal fees reflect costs incurred in both the administration and in a case the administrators took against former Quinn Insurance auditors PwC (PwC) for alleged negligent auditing, Grant Thornton said. PwC denied such claims but paid \u20ac54 million last year to settle the case, inclusive of the administrators\u2019 costs. PwC\u2019s costs were \u20ac25 million, bringing professional fees in the administration and associated litigation to some \u20ac85 million. [\u00a0 Quinn Insurance administrators provide 23 reports following Irish Times application \u00a0] [\u00a0 Coalition insists Quinn Insurance insolvency a matter for courts \u00a0] That sum is less than the \u20ac100 million calculation set out last week by The Irish Times in a report citing \u201clegal provisions\u201d for \u20ac32.47 million in litigation costs that the administrators set aside in annual accounts filed with the Companies Office. In a report to the court last June, the administrators said their own costs would have reached \u20ac60 million for prosecuting the PwC case if they lost the action. The progress reports were provided to the paper after it applied last week to Mr Justice David Barniville, president of the High Court, for access to the documents. Grant Thornton had previously declined to release the records and the Courts Service said it could not provide them as they were not in the case file. In a brief hearing on Friday, Mr Justice Barniville thanked the administrators for making the reports publicly available with very light redactions for commercial sensitivity. The documents set hourly rates paid to accountants and lawyers. The court-approved hourly rate for Grant Thornton partners was \u20ac375 from December 2011, down from \u20ac475 between March 2010 and November 2011. However, one an actuarial director with Grant Thorton UK was paid \u00a3625 per hour for work in 2012. The standard hourly rate excluding VAT for Maples & Calder partners was \u20ac485 but a court-approved 15 per cent discount was applied from Mary 2013, cutting the hourly rate for work by partners on Quinn Insurance to \u20ac410. The standard hourly rate for senior partners in McCann FitzGerald was \u20ac495. Such sums were discounted by 5 per cent after \u20ac500,000 in any year and the court-approved hourly rate was \u20ac470 between March 2010 and November 2011. From December 2011 onwards a 15 per cent discount was applied to the standard McCann FitzGerald hourly rates, bringing senior partners\u2019 fees to \u20ac420 and junior partners\u2019 fees to \u20ac382.",

            "date": "2022-04-27",
            "raw_text": "According to Cornmarket, the one area where families could make a saving is on their health insurance, without necessarily having to compromise on their cover. Cornmarket, Ireland\u2019s largest health insurance broker, saved their customers, on average, \u20ac404* on their health insurance. Here is some great advice to help save money on your family\u2019s health insurance: Splitting your cover It often doesn\u2019t make financial sense for all family members to be insured on the same health insurance plan. Did you know that each member can be insured on different plans yet remain on the same policy? This allows you to choose separate plans depending on each family member\u2019s individual needs and their life stage, which could help to reduce your costs. Kids\u2019 offers It is important to remember that young children will not be treated in some hi-tech hospitals. Therefore, a plan which offers cover for these hospitals may not be suitable for a child. However, by putting children on a different plan which is relevant to their needs, you may be able to reduce your costs. Also, it is worthwhile shopping around as some of the insurers provide kids\u2019 offers on different plans throughout the year. Take on an excess The excess is the first part of the claim you pay yourself, the insurer pays the rest. Most excesses range from \u20ac50 to \u20ac300. Plans that offer a higher excess allow you the option of saving money on your premium. Young adult rates Young adult rates have replaced student discounts and the good news is that the individual no longer has to be in full-time or part-time education to avail of this offer. You can avail of a young adult rate if you are aged between 18 to 25 years of age or if you have a dependent that fits within this age category. However, it is important to note that not all health insurance plans offer these discounted rates for young adults. Therefore, you should ask your insurer/broker for the best value plan for young adults that matches their needs. Compare insurance costs against everyday medical expenses Being able to claim for GP, physio, dentist and specialist consultant fees might seem a great idea for your health insurance, but is it actually costing you? Work out the maths first. Calculate what you can claim versus the extra cost of your premium for this type of cover. Review your cover every year If you\u2019ve had the same health insurance plan for years, it\u2019s worth reviewing. Automatically renewing your current plan can result in you paying more than you should. As new plans are released by insurers annually, Cornmarket\u2019s Health Insurance Comparison Service can help you find a new policy that gives your family great cover for less! Dermot Wells, head of general insurance at Cornmarket, comments: \u201cIt\u2019s important to review your cover each year to ensure that you\u2019re not overpaying for your cover and your plan continues to meet your needs. Insurers can make changes to your existing plan and unless you review your cover or read through your documents in detail, you could be caught unawares. Also, there are new plans developed each year, some specifically for corporate companies, but you are entitled to access these, many of which may offer greater value and benefits. By reviewing your cover, you will have peace of mind knowing you are on the right plan to meet your needs and budget.\u201d Cornmarket has a   one-of-a-kind online health insurance comparison tool  that makes finding the right health insurance policy as simple as possible.  and identifies any savings you can make.

            "raw_text": "Many hundreds of thousands of people with health insurance will see their policies come up for renewal in the weeks ahead and it is likely that well over half of them will end up wasting money because they don\u2019t shop around and ask the right questions of their providers. How much money will be needlessly spent will depend on the type of policy a person has and how long they have been on that policy but as a rule of thumb, anyone who has been on the same policy for three years and who stays put will probably end up paying around 25 per cent more than they need to over the next 12 months. Pricewatch has said this on many, many occasions in the past but this time it is not just Pricewatch who is saying it but the head of the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) Laura Brien whose job it is to guide people through the sometimes complex maze of health insurance. She points to the HIA\u2019s most recent research which looked at the price differentials between newer and older plans. For the exercise, the authority focused on two categories \u2013 plans that have been on the market for less than three years and those that have been on the market for more than three years. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that on average, the prices of the plans that were in existence, pre-2019 are 25 per cent, more expensive than the plans that have been introduced since then,\u201d she says. And how can that be? I can tell you straight away that 50 per cent of all people with health insurance are on the wrong plan \u201cWhat happens is that the insurers introduce good value plans to attract consumers into the market, then people stay on those plans and gradually prices go up over time, and [the insurers] introduce another new plan. So if you\u2019ve been on a plan for more than three years, the same plan, there\u2019s a very, very high probability that there\u2019s a better plan out there that has a comparable set of benefits.\u201d While the HIA tends to be agnostic about prices its does have a sense as to how much more people are paying as a result of an absence of shopping around. Brien says that if plans are broken down \u201cby a very simplistic categorisation, which is, you know, semi private room, how much of an excess or a shortfall is there than a person looking at a private room with a reasonable sort of mid level access [and] a shortfall say of \u20ac150 per claim, there are plans out there where you could save up to \u20ac1,000 from the most expensive to the cheapest plan within those categories. \u201cAnd that\u2019s per person. There are certain plans that have been out there for a very, very long time where the price has gone up every year and similar plans have been introduced more recently, with very comparable levels of benefits but at much lower rates.\u201d With savings of that magnitude on the table, people must be racing to the phones these days to take advantage of them? Not remotely. Brien suggests that only 29 per cent of people with health insurance or around three quarters of a million people have changed their insurance plan over the last two years. That means around 1.5 million people have not. She says there are \u201conly about 35 per cent of people who have ever switched, and a lot of people have only switched once\u201d. The figure is not, she notes, as bleak as a cursory glance might suggest because around 30 per cent of the market has health insurance through an employer which means \u201cthere there\u2019s a certain amount of the market, that\u2019s not going to be in the switching environment\u201d. But even so that is a lot of money that could be saved by a lot of people. \u201cPeople are conservative, they\u2019re risk averse,\u201d she says \u201cWe see this with older who are worried about pre-existing conditions, they\u2019re worried that if they switch provider and they have a pre-existing condition, they\u2019re not going to be covered, or they\u2019re going to have to wait for coverage and, that is not true. If you\u2019ve sat out your waiting periods with one insurer they carry over in the event of any pre-existing condition to another insurer. She stops short of saying the fears of older people are being a exploited by providers but says that the older age groups \u201chave an even higher level of inertia than the younger groups do\u201d and the system \u201cworks against people who have a high level of inertia and that probably applies across all age groups, although it applies more to the elderly.\u201d And the benefits of switching for the older people are greater than the younger people, because they tend to be paying on more for their insurance. \u201cThe over 65s pay between 40 and 45 per cent more for insurance than younger people do,\u201d Brien notes. \u201cSome of that is higher levels of benefit but a lot of that is the inertia that comes from being on the same plan for 10 or 15 years.\u201d Switching aside, the numbers with health insurance have been \u201ckind of ticking up quarter by quarter\u201d as the population grows and more people enter employment but also because people are more conscious of the trolley crisis and waiting lists and are doing what they can go protect themselves from the crisis. Hospital overcrowding is \u201ccertainly one of the things that came out in our survey, which was that, you know, access to hospitals and concern about waiting lists was one of the major drivers of deciding to take out health insurance. The cost of living crisis has yet to impact those numbers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen it just yet,\u201d she says, \u201cWe keep thinking it\u2019s going to turn around and it hasn\u2019t although if we go back to the financial crisis happened in 2008, the numbers with health insurance didn\u2019t start to decline until 2010 1112, and bottomed out in 2013. So there was a bit of a lag between people feeling the pinch in their pocket, and a decline in health insurance numbers.\u201d While the HIA has to be somewhat circumspect when discussing pricing, Dermot Goode, from health insurance brokers  totalhealthcover.ie  has no problem talking money and rarely pulls his poounches. \u201cI can tell you straight away that 50 per cent of all people with health insurance are on the wrong plan,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of older people are overspending by 30 to 40 per cent. And that\u2019s just purely down to inertia. They\u2019re afraid to move off the plans that are on the market for 30 years.\u201d He points to some of those older plans and their prices citing the VHI Health Plus Extra which is priced at \u20ac2,784, Laya\u2019s Essential Plus which costs \u20ac3,083 and Irish Life Level 2 Hospital Scheme, which is about \u20ac3,380. You must speak to the insurance companies and get them to verify everything or get an adviser who\u2019s qualified to do it for you just to make sure that you\u2019re making the right decisions, \u201cAre they all good plans? Yes. Are they good value? In my view, absolutely not. These are the plans that are held by a lot of older people and the challenge for these older members is that they want to save money but they all have existing underlying conditions and when they phone their insurance companies if there any little seed of doubt whatsoever and they\u2019re afraid to switch and then stay where they are.\u201d The frustration in his voice is evident when he adds that \u201cthese people can absolutely get amazing deals for anything from \u20ac1,800 to \u20ac2,000 so, can they realistically save maybe \u20ac1,000 a year and still have superb cover? The answer is absolutely yes. There\u2019s no such thing as loyalty, it\u2019s completely misguided, there is no benefit, no rewards for loyalty, in health insurance whatsoever.\u201d He says that if a person has a policy coming up for renewal and doesn\u2019t \u201cpick up the phone and put them under pressure\u201d then \u201cyou\u2019re already losing, the insurance company wins. That\u2019s number one. Number two, if you don\u2019t do your homework before you phone the insurance company, then you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d What does he mean by homework? \u201cPhoning up and saying what do you recommend means you\u2019ve lost. You have to put the right questions to them. In other words ask \u2018Do you have a lower cost equivalent plan to what I have that\u2019s similar and I am happy to take on some minor reductions, depending on the savings?\u2019 \u201d Utilities, electricity, gas equipment, prescription drugs, everything is going through the roof Another tip Goode has is to always start with your existing insurer. Not only will many people feel more comfortable staying with the insurer they have \u2013 maybe paying less by moving to a different plan \u2013 but the company will also have a complete record of all previous claims. \u201cYou can sit back with your mug of coffee and literally tell them everything that\u2019s important to you and ask them everything, covering every underlying condition and every procedure you\u2019ve had done, and get them to confirm that the new plan covers all of that. The clincher is your existing insurer will have all of your claims details on the screen so you just aske \u2018If I was on that new plan and had all those claims that you paid for me over the last two years, would they have been paid to the exact same degree?\u2019 That\u2019s all you have to do because the claims are sitting there in front of them and if they say yes then it makes the decision very easy for you.\u201d He points to a very specific example of the savings that are out there. \u201cA couple with the VHI\u2019s Health Plus Extra could stay with the VHI but look at its new plan Advanced Care 50 day to day which is \u20ac2,016. It is literally \u20ac750 cheaper so a retired couple could save \u20ac1,500 by switching to that plan and stay with the VHI.\u201d He also points to the importance of speaking to people rather than making modifications online. \u201cYou must speak to the insurance companies and get them to verify everything or get an adviser who\u2019s qualified to do it for you just to make sure that you\u2019re making the right decisions,\u201d he says while accepting that as he is just such an adviser he would say that. \u201cBut if you buy online, and don\u2019t speak to anybody, then effectively it\u2019s what we call \u2018execution, only\u2019, you are responsible fully, for the decision you make whether it\u2019s a good or bad decision because you haven\u2019t spoken to anybody. I always say to people, get on the phone and quiz them, check everything, tell them everything. The Irish psych, when it comes to insurance companies is to tell them nothing but the beauty about health insurance is you can tell them everything, because they can\u2019t refuse you. They can\u2019t load you. They can\u2019t change the terms because you\u2019ve disclosed something. And the more specific you are with your questioning, then the more specific their answers have to be and everything is recorded. And in fairness, they want to give people the right information at the at the right plans.\u201d He says that the savings are real and up for grabs for hundreds of thousands of people. \u201cI think the incredible thing is the people that do it properly. The first time it\u2019s the hardest time for the people to properly deal with this but the most common thing we hear back all the time is why didn\u2019t I do this 10 years ago? It\u2019s never too late though.\u201d He does warn that switching or no switching, price hikes are coming down the tracks as insurers are worried over rising claims as in the middle of a cost of living crisis, \u201ceverybody\u2019s claiming everything\u201d. He also points to the higher cost of inputs into the hospital. \u201cUtilities, electricity, gas equipment, prescription drugs, everything is going through the roof. We were surprised that they didn\u2019t move last year, because all the hospitals are telling us that their costs of running their business have literally increased by multiples. And that feeds into their negotiations with the insurance companies on increases.\u201d He points to a 5 per cent increase announced by Irish Life earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting the others to possibly increase their rates by a similar percentage by March 1st. And if we could get away with 5 per cent in terms of cumulative increase for this year, that\u2019d be a bonus but we are right back into back into rising costs right across the board for health insurance. Six ways to know if you\u2019re paying too much: If you\u2019re on the same plan for five years or more or paying more than \u20ac1,850 per adult If you\u2019ve never considered corporate plans which include a small excess per claim If you\u2019re afraid to change as you think you might have to serve waiting periods again If you have all the family on the same plan or you\u2019re paying the full rate for young adult If you\u2019re not getting 50 per cent to 75 per cent back on your out-patient expenses with no excess to pay And six steps you need to take: Shop around well before your renewal date Ask for the closest equivalent plan to what you have already Disclose everything that\u2019s important to you If you\u2019re happy with the answers, just switch! Switching doesn\u2019t mean you have to change insurer as in many cases you can get a better deal with the same insurer Talk to an expert or at the very least talk to the insurers and to make sure you understand the decisions you have to make",

            "raw_text": "Aviva Ireland's general insurance chief executive John Quinlan, who has been on leave for almost eight months, has launched legal proceedings against the company. It comes at a time when Aviva is known to be lining up a replacement for the executive. A spokeswoman for Aviva said that Mr Quinlan remained the chief executive of the Irish general insurance unit, but declined to comment further. The executive and his solicitors, named in court filings registering the case this week, did not respond to efforts to secure comment. The Irish Times first reported last November that Mr Quinlan was on leave from his position and that a senior executive with the wider UK-based Aviva group, Nick Amin, had been parachuted in to run the division on an interim basis. The legal proceedings are the first public confirmation of a breakdown in relations between Aviva and Mr Quinlan (55), who joined the company as general insurance managing director in 2013 from RSA Insurance Ireland, where he was the sales and marketing director. He was named chief executive of Aviva Ireland in November 2016, becoming its seventh head in a decade. The business was reorganised in September 2019 to align itself with the structures of the Aviva group. This eliminated the position of Aviva Ireland chief executive and left Mr Quinlan in charge of the general insurance business, with the life and pensions business headed up by another executive. Replacement It emerged last month that Declan O\u2019Rourke, general manager of US insurance giant AIG\u2019s Irish business, had been tapped to become the next chief executive of Aviva\u2019s general insurance business in Ireland. Aviva has not confirmed that Mr O\u2019Rourke is joining the company. Earlier this month, Aviva announced that Dave Elliot, who has been with the group for almost a decade, would be taking over as chief executive of its Irish life and pensions unit in August, succeeding Tom Browne, who joined the business in 2018 through the acquisition of Friends First. Mr Browne is retiring after 40 years working in the insurance industry in Ireland. London-based Aviva named independent director and former Zurich Insurance executive Amanda Blanc as its new chief executive on Monday, succeeding Maurice Tulloch. Ms Blanc immediately stoked speculation of a shake-up of the business. There has long been speculation of a break-up of the life and general insurer, which some analysts and investors say has an unwieldy structure. \u201cI\u2019m not a business-as-usual person, and I haven\u2019t come here to do a business-as-usual job,\u201d Ms Blanc, the first woman to run Aviva, told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe will look at the strategic options.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "A Tipperary water park fears it will be unable to reopen due to difficulty in renewing public liability insurance amid escalating premiums. Aqua Splash water park in Lough Derg has had to close as its UK-based insurer will not renew its coverage. The water park has faced a number of issues regarding securing insurance since its opening in 2016. Its original insurer stopped insuring the water park a number of years ago after a claim arose. \u201cWe were insured with them for four or five years. Once we got the claim in, they wouldn\u2019t insure us. They stopped insuring this whole sector anyway after that,\u201d said Aqua Splash owner Stephen Fitzgerald. The water park then had to switch to a UK-based insurer which led to the insurance premium \u201cgoing up probably five times the price, six times the price\u201d that it had been previously. \u201cAfter that year it just shot up through the roof,\u201d Mr Fitzgerald said. High risk This UK-based insurer has since pulled out of Ireland and will not renew Aqua Splash's coverage, which was due for renewal on July 12th. \"They [the insurance company] said it's too high risk for the water parks. Being honest I don't think it really is. Some parks in Ireland do get a lot of claims but it's the same as everything really. Anything that's got to do with activities, there's always going to be claims,\" said Mr Fitzgerald. \u201cIf someone else is having claims, that\u2019s the way they\u2019re running it. We shouldn\u2019t be painted with the same brush.\u201d Brexit has also been a matter of concern for insurers. \u201cA lot of the insurance companies that were in the UK, they\u2019re after pulling out as well due to Brexit. They won\u2019t even look at the company,\u201d he said. Mr Fitzgerald is now finding it almost impossible to find insurance for the water park. Its continued closure is causing him a \u201cmassive financial impact\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re at peak season now. This is when we should be busiest, we should be booked out,\u201d he said. However, he hopes to find a solution soon. \u201cWe have been on to an insurance crowd this morning. They\u2019re doing an insurance scheme with multiple businesses so they told us we would be a priority because we had to shut down. So I suppose there is a light at the end of the tunnel now.\u201d",

One million customers of Laya and Irish Life face increases in many cases running into double digit percentages in coming months and this was followed by announcement from the VHI of a 7 per cent rise. Premiums fell on average last year but have rebounded strongly and look set to remain under upward pressure. Post-Covid, claims numbers and costs are firmly on the rise. There are short- and long-term issues here. In the months ahead, the key issue for consumers is, of course, that many will be facing much higher costs. We must hope that competition, overseen by the Health Insurance Authority, is operating properly and that Axa\u2019s recent purchase of Laya Healthcare will give it some additional impetus. There is, however, evidence that the sector relies on the inertia of many customers, using new, cheaper policies to attract fresh business, while levying more from current policyholders. The message to customers is to shop around ahead of their policy renewal. They have nothing to lose; existing benefits will be retained if they move to another provider. The longer-term issue for health insurance, meanwhile, brings some uncertainty. What is its role if the Sl\u00e1intecare programme is fully implemented, removing private healthcare from public hospitals? In one scenario, the sector warns, this could lead to a loss of young members and a sharp rise in premiums for those remaining. This would happen if Sl\u00e1intecare\u2019s targets of cutting waiting lists and providing reliable services is met.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 In another scenario, if long waiting lists and other deficiencies remain, there may be an incentive for private hospitals to provide wider services, though whether this could be supported via a health insurance model is unclear. Either way, the challenges of reforming the healthcare system towards the desirable goal of universal access to decent services is complex and the pace of reform to date shows that there is a long way to go and some uncertainty about the final outcome.",

            "raw_text": "The recent decision by two health insurers to make innovative cancer treatments available more quickly to their customers is welcome. Irish Life Health and Laya Healthcare say they will make these life-preserving treatments available to subscribers once the drugs have been clinically approved by the European Medicines Agency. Their decision, taken after the issue was highlighted in this newspaper, will end the disparity in cover between these companies and their rival, VHI. The State-owned insurer has been funding these treatments since 2019. Over time, more immunotherapies have become available, treating a wider variety of cancers, thereby increasing the disparity in cover. The decision should reduce the time seriously ill patients have to wait for access to drugs by up to two years. Up to now the two companies waited until the HSE made a decision on reimbursing the treatments for public patients before giving the go-ahead to fund their own customers. The State\u2019s drug approval process is a lengthy one in which the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics first decides on the cost-effectiveness of a drug and the HSE then enters into price negotiations with the manufacturer. This stage takes place in secret, and is often protracted. Ireland is the second slowest country in western Europe for funding new drugs, a recent study found. The State has limited resources for funding new drugs and a duty to allocate these funds fairly for the widest patient benefit. That may mean resisting excessive price demands by drug manufacturers. Yet the extent of the delays in the process suggests a wider lack of urgency about ensuring public patients can avail of the best medicines.

            "raw_text": "The Central Bank has revealed insurance companies are making large profits from rising premiums while the cost of claims is falling, contradicting insurance industry claims and sparking fresh demands for Government action. The cost of motor insurance claims fell by 2.5 per cent in the last decade but premiums rose by 42 per cent, according to a Central Bank report which also revealed that insurers made an average of 9 per cent profit last year. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he was \"disappointed but not surprised\" at the findings, and added that a \"large part of the insurance problem is due to excessive profit-taking\" by the industry. Sinn F\u00e9in finance spokesman Pearse Doherty described the findings as a shocking indictment of the insurance industry, and criticised the Government for peddling the misinformation campaign of the insurance industry. Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s finance spokesman Michael McGrath said the Government\u2019s reform efforts were moving at \u201ca snail\u2019s pace\u201d. The report, published on Monday, is the Central Bank\u2019s first comprehensive study of premiums and cost claims and it appears to cast doubt on long-standing industry claims that the higher cost of car insurance is the result of spiralling payouts and increased claims, resulting in low profitability. It found the average cost of claims per policy fell by 2.5 per cent from \u20ac437 to \u20ac426 between 2009 and 2018 while average premiums jumped by 42 per cent from \u20ac498 to \u20ac706. Disparity The disparity is even starker when looking at the last five years. The report found that while the average cost of claims per policy rose by 14 per cent between 2013 and 2018 average premiums rose by 62 per cent. The report also revealed that the industry here generated an average operating profit of 9 per cent last year, nearly twice the level of profitability seen in the UK. Minister of State with responsibility for Financial Services and Insurance Michael D'Arcy said the report shows the insurance and legal sectors are both culpable for the difficulties over the last number of years with the price of motor insurance. The 10 years of data shows falling costs for motorists up to 2013 but the industry became loss-making and this peaked in 2014 \u201cIt appears that insurers engaged in underpricing in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses over parts of the period, particularly between 2014 and 2017, and are now making significant profits as a result,\u201d he said. Responding to the findings, Insurance Ireland, the umbrella group for insurers, said the 10 years of motor claims data published today shows personal injury and damage inflation is the main challenge for the sector. \u201cThe 10 years of data shows falling costs for motorists up to 2013 but the industry became loss-making and this peaked in 2014,\u201d Insurance Ireland chief executive Gerry Hassett said. \u201cThe industry was loss-making at this time and was impacted by increasing injury and damage claims costs, lower interest rate returns and the disruptive effects of failures like Setanta Insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cAs these trends increased from 2013 onwards, insurers had to provision for the inflation in injury and damage claims evident in the market and settlement times for claims of up to 4\u00bd years,\u201d Mr Hassett said.",

            "raw_text": "Irish Life Health has announced a 4.5 per cent hike to the price of its private health insurance plans which will apply from January 1st. The company said it was applying the changes as a result of \u201cvery substantial inflation\u201d in hospital procedure prices that has recently emerged. \u201cLike many parts of the economy, the hospitals have experienced significant increases in costs, which in turn has increased the cost of providing care to patients,\u201d it said. \u201cThe key contributory factors are the very material rise in energy and other supply costs, and the recent public-sector pay deal as it applies to healthcare staff.\u201d The changes vary across plans. The company\u2019s HealthGuide plans are to remain in line with the introductory price from February and First Cover, a recently launched entry-level plan, will have no increase applied. Irish Life Health managing director Ger Davis said: \u201cWe recognise that these changes will be difficult for customers who are already experiencing price increases in many areas. \u201cLike many other parts of the economy, the healthcare sector and particularly hospitals, is now experiencing significant inflationary pressure which will impact health insurance claims costs. [\u00a0 It\u2019s definitely time to have a look at how much health insurance is costing you \u00a0] \u201cWe are passing on the lowest possible increase we can, while ensuring that our customers continue to have comprehensive access to the care that they need. \u201cMaintaining this access is particularly important for our members as the healthcare system continues to experience significant challenges in dealing with the fallout from Covid.\u201d The new prices will apply for new customers from January 1st and existing customers as their renewals fall due from the same date.",

            "raw_text": "Over recent months we have received queries and complaints about travel insurance and two came in last week asking the same basic question. First up was Jarrod, who asked if we knew \u201cif anyone has successfully received a refund on multi-trip insurance or even a part refund given we were not able able to travel for most of 2020?\u201d He said he has lodged a formal complaint with his insurer, Vhi, but it was saying he could still travel \u2013 \"despite the Government discouraging it\". He pointed out that the same company\u2019s health insurance division had returned money to policyholders \u201cas we could not use hospitals, should travel not be the same?\u201d He said that instead of issuing refunds, the company was \u201coffering a pointless free six months extension of cover [when] we still can\u2019t travel.\u201d Vhi has been sending its travel insurance customers a letter telling them about the extension. \u201cWe understand that Covid-19 is having a significant impact on travel, making it difficult for you to use your Vhi MultiTrip travel insurance,\u201d the letter starts with significant understatement. \u201cIn recognition of this and to thank you for your continued loyalty, we are providing you with an additional six months cover on your Vhi MultiTrip policy from your renewal date of February 14th, 2021, at no extra cost. This means that you are now covered until August 13th, 2021, and you will not be charged for the additional six months,\u201d the correspondence continues. Accommodation In a telling warning it adds that \u201cthe policy does not provide cover for claims relating to Covid-19 with the exception of emergency medical treatment abroad\u201d. It concludes by saying that as \"more people have decided to holiday in Ireland, you will also have cover for any trips within Ireland, once you stay a minimum of one night and you have pre-booked and paid for your accommodation, prior to your departure\". Another reader called Angela mailed us and started by saying she was \u201cnot happy\u201d. \u201cI buy annual travel insurance every year for the family,\u201d she says. She does not identify the company. \u201cI always auto renew so no gap in cover. I renewed in June 2020 for the family at a cost of \u20ac78.26 stupidly thinking that we might get away in 2020,\u201d she says. \u201cWe aim to be a Covid-compliant family so would not dream of stepping on a plane for a family dental appointment in Tenerife. For some reason our travel insurance policy flashed into my head this morning. I have paid for it but have not had any benefit from it and nor will we have any benefit from it for the rest of the insurance period. I rang the insurance company and they said to get a full refund I would have had to cancel within 14 days of putting policy in place,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will refund me \u20ac25 on a pro rata basis. So if I had my light bulb travel insurance moment in say September 2020 they confirmed I would have got more money back. I think this is wrong and insurance companies are benefiting from our misfortune. I think it would have been reasonable to get a full refund minus say an admin charge of, say, \u20ac20,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey asked me if I wanted to lodge a complaint so I said yes please. We will see how it goes but maybe there would be benefit in bringing this issue to light on a national level.\u201d Response We contacted the Vhi and a spokeswoman said the company \u201cunderstands that Covid-19 has had an impact on people\u2019s ability to travel\u201d. She said that since last March it had rolled out a \u201crange of measures to support customers who have Vhi Multi-trip\u201d. She pointed to enhanced cover for trips in Ireland, a reduction in the price of the annual Vhi MultiTrip policy and an extension of the cooling-off period from 14 to 28 days for customers renewing. She also said there was cover for Covid-19 cancellation claims for all renewing customers who booked holidays prior to 19th March 2020 and she said there was an extension of cover for six months free of charge. \u201cMultiTrip is an annual policy where premium is paid upfront for the renewal year and cover is available immediately. Due to Covid-19, there was a spike of cancellation-related claims last spring and summer as people had to cancel their trips and we\u2019ve continued to see travel claims throughout the remainder of 2020. Cover for cancellation is one of the main reasons people take out travel insurance,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cVhi MultiTrip is different from our health insurance product. We provided two premiums waivers for our health insurance customers because claims were lower than anticipated. We also waived a portion of premium for our dental customers again because claims were lower than anticipated.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Merger and acquisition activity within the Irish insurance brokerage market is showing no signs of abating with Howden-owned Aston Lark on Wednesday announcing that it has acquired Dublin-based Pembroke Insurances. The deal follows  several years of unprecedented consolidation  within the Irish brokerage market, which continues to attract private equity investment. Aston Lark, which entered the Irish market in 2021 backed by Goldman Sachs, has now completed 13 acquisitions in less than 18 months, mostly recently with Athlone\u2019s Gateway Insurance and Investments, which it bought in September for an undisclosed price. Pembroke Insurances, founded in 2007 by Graham Weir and John McGuire \u2013 the duo behind broker Quote Devil, which was sold to private equity-backed Three Rock group earlier this year \u2013 had revenues of close to \u20ac1.5 million in 2021, according to its most recent set of accounts.

            "raw_text": "On May 1st, 2004, European leaders from across the Continent gathered on the lawn outside \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in and watched as a flag was raised to mark the enlargement of the European Union to include 10 new member states. Less than 24 hours later, Anna Siewierska, a Polish nurse, stepped off the plane at Dublin Airport and jumped on a bus into the city centre, ready to begin a new life as an EU citizen. Three months later her two daughters, Joanna and Katarzyna, followed her to their new Irish home. \u201cI think for that first wave of Polish migrants, they were really searching for a better life,\u201d says Joanna Siewierska, now a 27-year-old legal executive. Siewierska did not speak a word of English when she arrived in Ireland and was the first Polish student, along with her sister, in the small national school they attended in Artane. \u201cI was so young but I don\u2019t recall being particularly scared or fazed by it. I don\u2019t think the move was ever fully explained but I understood it was permanent.\u201d By secondary school, Siewierska was involved in student politics and joined the Irish Second Level Students\u2019 Union. Four years later she was elected the first non-Irish born UCD student union president. Growing up in Dublin, she had a strong connection to her north Dublin home in Coolock. It was only at university that she started reconnecting with her Polish identity. \u201cBeing from Coolock was always a big part of my identity in Ireland. To this day I introduce myself as a Polish woman from Coolock.\u201d \u201cStaying in touch with Polish links takes a bit more work but it\u2019s important too. Everybody makes their own decision about how much they lean into their Polish roots.\u201d [\u00a0 Why is Ireland\u2019s Polish community returning home? \u00a0] This identity, both as an Irish-Pole and as a woman from Coolock, has \u201ctaken on a new meaning\u201d since the November 2023 Dublin riots, she adds. \u201cWith my accent and my skin colour, I fit in. But I have a Polish passport, a big Polish surname and I speak the Polish language. \u201cMaybe the people who write \u2018Foreigners out\u2019 on the walls aren\u2019t thinking of the daughter of a nurse who\u2019s worked in the Irish healthcare system for 20 years. But we\u2019re receiving that message too, and it makes all of us uncomfortable.\u201d She still holds a Polish passport. She is one of the 93,680 Poles living in Ireland today, according to census figures. Another 17,152 Irish-Polish dual nationals are registered as living in Ireland. The number of Poles living in Ireland has dropped in recent years, down from 122,515 in 2016. Poles were once the largest foreign national group in Ireland but are now outnumbered by the more 106,200 Ukrainians who have moved here since 2022. However, more than 123,900 people in Ireland still speak Polish, and small numbers continue to relocate here \u2013 5,441 Polish nationals moved to Ireland between January 2023 and March 2024, according to Department of Social Protection data. \u2018There\u2019s a struggle getting work you are qualified for. I fully considered leaving Ireland last year\u2019 Dr Agnieszka Piwowarczyk, an environmental scientist and soil expert, moved to Ireland in July 2004, having previously visited Galway as a non-EU citizen in 2003. \u201cI remember walking down Shop Street when I moved over, and I couldn\u2019t believe my ears. In 2003 you could hear lots of Spanish and Italian but this was overtaken by the Polish community very quickly.\u201d Piwowarczyk, who has lived in Donegal, Cork and Dublin but is now based in Sligo, says that even after two decades here, it remains difficult to fully integrate. \u201cEven though Poles and Irish are culturally very similar in terms of history, religion and occupation, you\u2019re always going to be a blow-in, no matter how long you live in a place.\u201d She loves living on the west coast but says people\u2019s reaction when they discover she is Polish has changed in recent years. \u201cWhen I arrived people knew very little about Poland. It was nice to share information about our culture, food, nature. But now, certain groups make you feel like you\u2019re threatening them. Not necessarily to your face, but you can feel it behind your back.\u201d Many highly educated Poles are unable to develop their careers in Ireland, she says. \u201cI work hard, I have amazing experience and I\u2019m an expert in many fields. But there\u2019s a struggle getting work you are qualified for and being paid the same as Irish people for the same work. And because of this, I fully considered leaving Ireland last year.\u201d [\u00a0 Losing its religion: Catholic Poland looks to Irish example as it moves towards secularism \u00a0] \u2018There\u2019s a noticeable lack of engagement in Irish politics among us\u2019 Barnaba Dorda, Siptu Workers\u2019 Rights Centre advocate and head of the Polish-Irish advocacy group Forum Polonia, agrees Poles who have lived here for years \u201crarely get to climb the career ladder up to managerial roles in the professional sector\u201d. Last year the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) found eastern European workers earned, on average, 40 per cent less than Irish workers. \u201cWe are not visible as role models for society. Instead, most of us end up in lower-paying jobs.\u201d The housing crisis and precarious rental situation makes it difficult for many Poles to feel \u201cfully settled and part of the broader community\u201d, he adds. When he moved to Ireland in 2005, he planned on staying three months. However, he found a job with Siptu and, two decades on, has two children and owns a house in Dublin. Dorda, a lawyer, considered returning to Poland during the recession, when he was offered a job in his home country. However, he liked working with Irish trade unions and chose to stay. Some of his friends have returned in recent years. \u201cSome went back and secured very good jobs with their English-language skills. Others left Ireland because of the housing crisis and high rents.\u201d Many Poles who moved to Ireland and started families are hopeful that life will be easier for their Irish-born children, who \u201care more immersed in Irish culture and language\u201d, he adds. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s a real concern that the problems their parents face could affect them too, limiting their opportunities for true integration.\u201d As director of Forum Polonia, Dorda has run campaigns encouraging Poles to engage with Irish politics. He remembers thousands of Poles queuing outside the embassy on Ailesbury Road in Dublin waiting to vote in Poland\u2019s 2007 elections. This prompted Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael to hire Polish-speaking officers to reach out and find local election candidates. Nine Polish candidates ran in the 2009 and 2014 local elections, but just three took part in 2019, and only one woman has registered as a candidate in the upcoming vote in June. \u201cPolitically, our voices are largely unheard,\u201d says Dorda. \u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable lack of engagement in Irish politics among us, perhaps because we don\u2019t see how it could benefit us, or maybe we don\u2019t feel welcome in those spaces.\u201d \u2018The whole experience of going through the health system was actually very positive\u2019 Renata Koronkiewicz, who moved to Ireland in 2007, does not keep up with any politics, Irish or Polish. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not interested. If I lived in Poland I\u2019d probably make myself go and vote. But that\u2019s because we have such bad politics in Poland and also maybe because I know more about Polish politics and history.\u201d Koronkiewicz, a social care worker specialising in supports for adults with intellectual disabilities, lives in Arklow with her husband and two daughters. She never planned on staying here long term. But she ended up going through two rounds of cancer treatment in Irish hospitals. \u201cIt was a huge shock, to be honest. I had breast cancer twice. In 2015 I found a lump on my breast \u2013 I was diagnosed the first time in 2018 and the second time two years ago. But the whole experience of going through the health system was actually very positive.\u201d Koronkiewicz says the care she has received, both from her oncologist but also post treatment, as she goes through premature menopause as a result of the chemotherapy, has been brilliant. \u201cHere I didn\u2019t have to pay for the medication, and all my chemotherapy happened on time.\u201d She likes to joke that when the family win the Euromillions lottery, they will \u201cbuy a B&B in the Polish mountains with horses. But my daughters say they don\u2019t want to leave, this is their home\u201d. \u201cFor me it\u2019s more in-between \u2013 when I visit Poland it doesn\u2019t feel like home any more, but Ireland isn\u2019t 100 per cent home either.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s still an underlying xenophobia in Ireland, so we stick together subconsciously\u2019 Irish born, 15-year-old Kalina Kubas, who lives in Ballyfermot with her Polish parents, feels Irish, but find she shares a deeper connection with second-generation immigrants rather than peers with Irish backgrounds. Kalina was born in 2008, three years after her mother, Aneta, left her career in journalism in Poland and moved to Ireland. Growing up in Ballyfermot, she recalls feeling \u201cembarrassed that I wasn\u2019t Irish\u201d. Classmates poked fun at the pierogi she sometimes brought to school in her lunchbox and told her Polish food was \u201cf***ing disgusting\u201d, she says. \u201cI felt like being Polish was something I should be ashamed of. But as I grew older, I started to form my own opinions and that\u2019s when I started being proud of my heritage.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very proud that she came to this realisation by herself,\u201d says her mother, who runs the Polish library in Inchicore and works for a charity supporting homeless central and eastern Europeans. \u201cI never pushed her to learn Polish, but it\u2019s a big asset to have two cultures, two languages.\u201d Kalina loves hanging out around Moore Street, where she meets other young people of mixed heritage. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m part of that community. Because there\u2019s still an underlying xenophobia in Ireland, so we stick together subconsciously. \u201cI was raised in a Polish household and go to Poland a lot but I\u2019m integrated into Irish culture at school. I\u2019m basically a mix of both.\u201d \u2018Losing all my achievements from my life in Poland and starting from scratch, that was tough\u2019 Olga Anacka, who moved here in 2006, also speaks of the \u201cotherness\u201d migrants feel in this country. While acknowledging she had an easier experience as a white, European migrant, she recalls being treated differently because of her accent and lack of spoken English. \u201cWhen you do not speak a language fluently, who you are as a person is gone. Initially, when I could not express myself properly, I think some people thought I had nothing to say. It was like losing my voice.\u201d A visual artist, Anacka was one of those chosen at random as a recipient of the Government\u2019s basic income for the arts pilot scheme in 2022. This additional financial support has allowed her to reignite the artistic career she buried when she moved to Ireland nearly two decades ago. For years, she pushed aside this passion for art while she worked shifts at a Co Wicklow factory so she could care for her children and pay the bills. \u201cThe factory experience taught me not to be so proud. You think your identity is clear, but when you\u2019re forced to move outside your area, that identity is questioned. Losing all my achievements from my life in Poland and starting from scratch, that was tough.\u201d \u2018I think it\u2019s important to realise this is your new home\u2019 Marcin Jazewski, now head of operations for the Rehab Group, also started from zero when he arrived in Ireland from the UK in 2008, leaving behind a role as an operations manger to \u201cthrow meat on a lorry\u201d. \u201cI was basically looking for a better life. That\u2019s why I went to the UK first, where I worked in the construction industry. But that was hit badly by the financial crisis, so I came here.\u201d Unlike others interviewed in this article, Jazewski has never experienced \u201cany animosity for being Polish\u201d and believes if any migrant works hard, \u201cyou can achieve whatever you want\u201d. He also believes many Poles in Ireland struggle to integrate because they continue telling themselves they will move home some day. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to realise this is your new home. The moment I realised I was never going back, things really changed for me.\u201d At the time of this interview, his wife, Srijita, is just days away from giving birth to their first child. The son of a Polish-immigrant father and Indian immigrant mother who live in Ireland, this little boy will grow up with \u201cthree cultures\u201d. \u201cWe want that mix of cultures to be an integral part of our child\u2019s life. We want him to speak Polish, Bengali and English. And then he\u2019ll learn Irish at school. \u201cFrom my perspective, exposure to all those cultures will be a huge advantage to him through his life.\u201d Poles who returned home from Ireland: \u2018I\u2019ve learned to enjoy the chat and appreciate common connections\u2019 Architect Szymon Krawczewski\u2019s journey to Ireland and back to  Poland  sounds like a perfect European enlargement success story. Two decades ago he and his girlfriend \u2013 now wife \u2013 heard how Celtic Tiger Ireland was crying out for people with architectural skills. Seeking adventure and a chance to improve their English they arrived in July 2004. By August Krawczewski began with the architectural firm RKD, which operates worldwide and is perhaps best known in Ireland for the Guinness Gravity Bar. Still with RKD 20 years later, Krawczewski returned to Poland in August 2023 to head RKD\u2019s Krak\u00f3w office. Of his two decades of life and work experience in Ireland, Krawczewski says the pragmatic Irish approach to addressing problems is what he values most. \u201cWhat I learned in Ireland is that my job is not to come to clients with issues but to advise them how to solve them,\u201d Krawczewski says. The pandemic  remote working  revolution means his wife has kept her Irish job, while being closer to their parents \u2013 now in their 70s \u2013 is a big bonus. Eight months back in Poland, they still notice the differences in daily life. \u201cThe Irish look and sound cheerful with an open smile, when you go into a shop the lady calls you \u2018love\u2019,\u201d says Krawczewski. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear \u2018love\u2019 here. Ask Poles how they are, you get their full life story and full medical and financial history.\u201d Their  Dublin -born teenage daughter is having a harder adjustment. \u201cShe complains the Polish teenagers are not as happy as Irish teenagers. She preferred the spontaneous, cheerful joy of living in Ireland,\u201d Krawczewski says. Joanna Augustyniak, a 40-year-old university lecturer from Koszalin in northern Poland, likes to tell her two children \u2013 aged six and 10 \u2013 that \u201cI started my adult life in Ireland\u201d. She moved with her boyfriend in the summer of 2006 and stayed for four years in the  Galway  region. While working in factories there she also researched a doctorate on the challenges Polish children and teens face integrating into Irish society. Augustyniak faced challenges of her own on her return home in 2010: learning the unwritten rules of Polish life from people who could not understand how an adult like her did not know them already. Even now her husband still uses Irish words and phrases like \u201cI need my bed\u201d while Augustyniak has retained the more assertive approach towards employment she picked up in Ireland: work to live, don\u2019t live to work. \u201cI really like this, I\u2019ve made it my life motto,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect myself more and I care less what a boss says.\u201d Ask engineer Piotr Sokolowski what he learned from Ireland and he mentions people skills. He has spent the last 20 years commuting back and forth to Ireland, living there for extended periods to study at Dublin Institute of Technology, now TU Dublin, and work in the headquarters of his Irish employer, S3 Connected Health. A digital health partner for pharmaceutical and medtech companies, S3 employs 170 people in Wroclaw. When it opened there 25 years ago, Sokolowski remembers the traditions brought over by the first generation of Irish managers \u2013 in particular after-work drinks on Friday. \u201cI used to think \u2018Jesus, again\u2019 but then I realised how much it contributed to building relationships and being able to work well together,\u201d says Sokolowski. \u201cThat was nonexistent in Poland 20 years ago but now it has developed.\u201d Experiencing in Ireland first-hand what he calls the \u201cpositive and welcoming attitude\u201d towards Polish arrivals like him means Sokolowski has a more positive attitude to recent arrivals in his homeland from neighbouring Ukraine. Turning 50 in October, Sokolowski tries to retain in Poland what he calls his Irish \u201centry-level chattiness and curiosity\u201d towards others. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to not only enjoy the chat but to appreciate how the Irish look for common connections,\u201d he says, already planning new connections of his own this summer with a plan to walk the Irish coastline.

            "raw_text": "Soaring insurance costs have led to the cancellation of most motorcycle road races in Northern Ireland for 2023. The sport\u2019s governing body, the Motorcycle Union of Ireland Ulster Centre (MCUIUC) released a statement on Thursday evening following an emergency meeting indicating that all events \u2013 including short circuit racing and trials \u2013 could not go ahead due to \u201cunsustainable\u201d costs for clubs. Quotes for public liability insurance, which covers injury to people and damage to property, have tripled to \u00a3400,000. Cancelled events across the North include the Cookstown 100, Tandragee 100, Armoy road races, Ulster Grand Prix and the Sunflower Trophy at Bishopscourt. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 However, organisers of the flagship North West 200 race (NW200) \u2013 Northern Ireland\u2019s largest outdoor sporting event \u2013 released a statement on Friday saying it \u201chad not given up the fight\u201d. The weeklong race takes place in May and generated more than \u00a317 million to the economy last year. Race launch events scheduled for next week are due to take place as the MCUI released a second statement on Friday saying it was preparing a rescue package and needed to raise \u00a3500,000. \u201cWe cannot afford the premium hikes but nor can we afford to stop the events,\u201d said MCUI chairman John Dillon. \u201cMembers of the MCUIUC board and I are now urgently pursuing a series of options and sources including the launch of a crowd funding campaign. \u201cIf racing doesn\u2019t take place in 2023, not only will it be nearly impossible to bring it back in 2024, we will also lose the new riders coming through the ranks.\u201d Mr Dillion said that motorcycle racing, especially road racing, is \u201cunique on the island of Ireland\u201d. \u201cIt is part of our culture and heritage and we\u2019ve been racing on roads for over 100 years. MCUIUC licence holders have always and continue to punch well above their weight and we are proud to have many world champions that come from Northern Ireland. \u201cThese world champions, the likes of Joey Dunlop and more recently Jonathan Rea, are ambassadors not only for our sport but for Northern Ireland as well.\u201d The Coleraine and District Motor Club, which is responsible for arranging the North West races, said they \u201chave been working tirelessly to mitigate the pressure created by these extra costs\u201d: \u201cThe club was confident it could manage the initial premium increase, but with other events unable to do so the transfer of extra charges to the North West 200 created an unsustainable financial burden. \u201cThe organisers of the NW200 have not given up the fight. We cannot afford to lose an event that has been running for over 90 years and plays such a vital role in the economy of the north coast area. \u201cWe have been overwhelmed by the messages and offers of support we have received today and whilst we understand the decision taken by the MCUI (UC), the Coleraine and District Motor club will continue in its efforts to stage the North West 200 on May 7th-13th.\u201d Similar fate Sean Bissett, president of Motorcycling Ireland, said road races in the Republic could face a similar fate as those in the North. They are waiting to receive an insurance quote for their races and expect to receive it next week. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been quoted yet, but the Ulster Centre were quoted in the region of \u20ac480,000. It wasn\u2019t the price that was the issue, it was the excess. The excess was \u20ac300,000 so in essence, you would almost be underwriting yourself,\u201d he said. Mr Bissett said there have been a number of \u201cmajor incidents\u201d at races in the Republic that resulted in insurance claims over the past five years. \u201cIt means now when we go looking for a new broker, they look for our five-year claims and they find it very unattractive,\u201d he added. In the Republic, there are around 120 events per year and six major road races that take place in various counties including Meath, Dublin and Tipperary. \u201cEvery one of these races, you have 200 riders, maybe 150 officials at it and 20,000 spectators. They\u2019re a big loss for them areas. We\u2019re like a moving circus from town to town for the tourism in the areas,\u201d Mr Bissett said. Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist Party MLA Mike Nesbitt, who chairs the Stormont All-Party Group on Sport and Recreation, said the issue should be addressed by government. \u201cI understand last year\u2019s North West 200 pumped \u00a317.4 million into the local economy, 110,000 visited the races on the Saturday alone, nearly a quarter of visitors were from out of state, creating nearly 65,000 bed nights,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThis is another compelling reason to get Stormont back up and running.\u201d Six riders were killed in the Isle of Man TT races and one rider in the Republic last year.",

The details of the new code published last week by Insurance Ireland are to be welcomed. However, a voluntary code of conduct by its very nature is not legally binding. It is imperative that we move beyond mere guidelines and establish binding legislation that ensures proper enforcement. Over 200,000 people in Ireland are living beyond a cancer diagnosis, many of whom have already experienced considerable medical, psychological, and financial challenges in their survivorship journey. It is not enough to rely solely on the voluntary cooperation of insurance companies. Robust oversight, penalties for non-compliance, and regular audits should be established to hold these entities accountable.

In January of this year, I was delighted to learn that the European Parliament and European Council agreed to include my amendments on a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d clause for insurance products in the new legislation. Now it is time to ensure that the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d is implemented nationally.

Whilst the focus may have, necessarily, been upon what shortfall might arise in the context of a total, or catastrophic, loss, homeowners should be acutely aware that the \u201cunderinsurance\u201d or \u201caverage\u201d clause will proportionately reduce the level of settlement for each claim. Total-losses are, thankfully, rare occurrences. Most domestic insurance claims are for more modest amounts, and yet, when deductions for underinsurance are applied, the policyholder can often be left with a gap that must be filled through the use of savings or loans or a combination of both. This is not satisfactory. The \u201cunderinsurance\u201d (or \u201caverage\u201d) clause is a mechanism that originated in commercial insurance. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 There is clear authority that UK courts will not imply the principle of \u201caverage\u201d to household policies. Indeed, most domestic insurance policies issued by UK insurers do not incorporate underinsurance clauses. It is our experience as policyholder representatives that underinsurance has now become the key factor that limits claim payments, often with catastrophic effects for the policyholder. A domestic policyholder cannot be an expert in determining the building sum insured. For that reason, and in the shadow of the Consumer Protection Code and the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act, the continued presence of the anachronistic \u201caverage\u201d clause in Irish household insurance policies cannot be justified. \u2013 Yours, etc, JOHN O\u2019DONOGHUE, Cork.",

            "raw_text": "Promises by insurers in the Republic that they would move rapidly to cut motor premiums as a result of new judicial guidelines for personal injury awards would appear, on the face of it, to have been a load of hot air. The average award from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) dropped by 42 per cent from the adoption of the new guidelines by the Judicial Council last April and the end of the year, a report from the board shows. However, data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) indicate that motor insurance costs for consumers fell by just 8.6 per cent last year. The devil is in the detail. The PIAB report highlighted that just 37 of the awards it had put forward were accepted last year. That\u2019s down from a traditional level of about 50 per cent. The spike in rejections last year, mainly by claimants believing they could get more by taking their case to court, is a worrying development \u2013 especially when the guidelines, set by judges, are supposed to do away with any notion that someone could do better by essentially bypassing PIAB. There are vested interests in propagating this fiction. There is a real need for data on awards coming through the courts system and figures from insurers on the levels at which they are settling cases Central Bank figures have consistently shown in recent years that even before the judicial guidelines, most claimants gained very little financially \u2013 and only lost time \u2013 by taking the legal route. The spike in PIAB award rejections comes as a series of High Court cases challenging the constitutionality of laws underpinning the judicial guidelines make their way through the courts. A hearing of the lead challenge concluded last Friday, with a judgment expected in the coming months. The sooner, the better. And there is a real need for data on awards coming through the courts system and figures from insurers on the levels at which they are settling cases. CSO figures suggest that motor coverage costs have come down by about 40 per cent since 2016, following a 70 per cent spike in the three years before then as the industry raced to recover from a period of massive losses. But Irish insurers\u2019 motor profits have only been going one way. There\u2019s plenty in the tank to pass on to consumers.",

            "raw_text": "Revolut will offer car insurance to motorists in the Irish market after agreeing a partnership with insurance giant AIG. The fintech, one of Europe\u2019s most valuable, company will offer the chance to buy Revolut car insurance to 3,000 customers from today and then roll out the product to all customers in the coming months, it said. Revolut, which has two million users in Ireland, said its app would take \u201cjust minutes\u201d to issue customers a quote for their car insurance. \u201cWith this launch we aim to change the way Irish customers buy, view and manage their car insurance. Getting a quote in our app is now quick and intuitive, with fewer screens and less friction than the traditional ways of buying insurance,\u201d said Cian O\u2019Toole, the company\u2019s global strategy and operations manager for insurance. Revolut will offer customers the ability to pay in 12 monthly instalments with no upfront down-payment. It said this was aligned with the expectations of modern consumers who are used to monthly subscriptions for services. Customers who pay upfront, however, will pay 10 per cent less. Customers will be able to view, amend or cancel their policy through the app without being charged any administration fees, although associated premium adjustments may apply. Revolut suggested its policies would be up to 30 per cent cheaper than its competitors in the Irish market. A discount of as much as 10 per cent will be available to customers with a subscription to one of the company\u2019s paid plans, while discounted premiums will also be available to Revolut customers using Smart Driving, a new self-install, in-car telematics device. \u201cHelping people drive more safely is good for everyone. Fewer accidents ultimately saves lives but it also means fewer claims \u2013 and that helps cut insurance costs for everyone, most importantly the customer,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Toole. Revolut, which launched in the UK in 2015 offering money transfer and exchange, now has 30 million customers around the world. The company, which describes itself as a \u201cglobal super-app\u201d, has added a number of new products and features in the Irish market in recent months in a bid to make itself more attractive to users who may opt for the fintech as their primary bank. Earlier this year, it completed the roll-out of Irish international bank account numbers (Ibans) to customers here. While its valuation has soared since it was launched, investors have slashed their value of their holding since the global economy slowed. In June Molten Ventures, a Dublin- and London-listed tech investment company formerly known as Draper Esprit,  wrote down its stake  in Revolut by 40 per cent.",

            "raw_text": "Insurance is the classic grudge purchase. There are few if any other products we will ever buy that we hope never to use. We don\u2019t buy motor insurance with the intention of being in a car crash, we don\u2019t buy health cover with a plan to get sick and we certainly don\u2019t want our homes to go on fire when we purchase house insurance. Even when we take out a life insurance policy, it\u2019s in the knowledge that someone else is going to benefit from it. But car crashes happen and houses go on fire and we need insurance to protect ourselves against such eventualities. Fortunately, insurance companies are extremely good at managing risk and providing that protection to their customers. On the other hand, they have also tended to be quite conservative and slow to innovate. There is change afoot, however. \u201cInsurance is adapting to not only keep up with but keep ahead of emerging risks,\u201d says John Kelleher, head of corporate risk and broking with WTW Ireland. \u201cIt is no longer the slow and conservative industry some might imagine. There has been a strong shift towards innovation in recent years and that trend is only accelerating. It\u2019s driven by technology, competition and evolving client needs. There is a relentless focus on improving the customer experience and mining big data in the smartest ways.\u201d The industry is turning to technology to streamline and improve how it engages with clients, he adds. \u201cWe are embedding this across all processes, from risk quantification to underwriting and claims management. Big data is giving us more insights than we have ever had, allowing for the creation of bespoke products and increasingly sophisticated pricing models. Our clients are at the heart of everything we do. They are demanding tailored solutions, more personalisation and quicker response times. Generic solutions no longer fulfil client needs and demands and that is where technology brings a competitive edge.\u201d PwC technology advisory partner and insurance sector lead Darren O\u2019Neill believes evolving customer needs and preferences will drive far-reaching changes to the traditional insurance product suite. \u201cCustomers will increasingly want personalised solutions presented in the context of their day-to-day lives, be it while buying a car, buying a pension and planning for retirement, managing their health or starting and running a business. Customers expect insurers to go beyond their risk-transfer obligations and offer end-to-end solutions, covering risk prediction, prevention and intervention and to underpin those services with a seamless customer experience.\u201d The Irish industry is actively engaging in the development of new technology-enabled solutions. \u201cThe competitive success of Irish insurance depends on innovation, which is driven in no small part by collaboration,\u201d says Insurance Ireland chief executive Moyagh Murdock. \u201cOne way to look at innovation is as a hedge against disruption and rapid industry change. By innovating, companies can keep pace with fast-evolving competitors, customers and technologies without getting left behind. That is why the Irish insurance industry came together with a number of stakeholders to establish  instech.ie , where established businesses and start-ups can join forces to create the next generation of solutions.\u201d InsTech aims to be a bridge between start-up technology companies in the insurtech space and established companies in the insurance industry, according to its chief executive Gary Leyden. \u201cTechnology has given the industry the ability to do new things, but companies haven\u2019t been using it,\u201d he says. \u201cLike a lot of regulated industries, insurance companies have difficulty with legacy systems which present technical barriers to using new technologies.\u201d But the new wave of insurtech firms is helping the industry overcome those obstacles. \u201cIn the motor space, insurers are integrating telematics to deliver real-time information on what kind of driver you are at an individual level,\u201d says Leyden. \u201cYou get a better price for being a better driver. Ultimately, this leads to better driver behaviour.\u201d Usage-based insurance is another innovative product gaining traction on the market. \u201cYou might only drive one day a week,\u201d says Leyden. \u201cThe whole concept of mobility is changing. The same journey could include a scooter, an e-bike, a train and a car. Insurance companies are building platforms around mobility and Irish companies like Inaza are helping them to do it.\u201d Kelleher sees even greater scope for this technology. \u201cWith the increasing shared economy, what if this could track and assign premium allocations to respective drivers within a household or car-share arrangement?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat if this could be used as an education tool to physically warn drivers when they are driving in a way which might increase insurance premiums?\u201d Innovation goes beyond pricing and cover models and extends to climate action. \u201cOur industry has an important role to play in helping others understand their ESG and climate-related risks, so that they can report on them, and so we can try to manage and insure them,\u201d Kelleher points out. \u201cInnovations in this area include sophisticated weather modelling and risk analytics systems that allow for real-time risk assessment globally. These techniques are part of a bigger aim to work closely with our clients to embed a climate change culture.\u201d Artificial intelligence (AI) is also making its mark. \u201cThere are many very interesting and innovative examples of AI being deployed, including conversational AI for virtual customer assistants,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cOther uses include the assessment of images of damage submitted via a smartphone and interpreting and processing contents from documents including medical assessments, identity cards and so on as well as searching for unusual patterns in large data sets to detect fraud.\u201d Kelleher believes blockchain will play an increasingly important role in the industry. \u201cIt will allow for more protected data sharing. It improves both security and transparency. From claims management to premium payment, optimising this technology streamlines processes for both consumers and insurers. And it also offers protection against fraud, which is one of the major risks within the insurance industry.\u201d Looking to the future, he says insurance is set to continue its journey of evolution and innovation in the coming years. \u201cIt\u2019s being driven by new technologies, changing customer expectations and increasing competition. Those that are agile and can adapt to these changes and embrace new opportunities will be the ones that succeed.\u201d",

The paper was \u201cvery grateful\u201d for the court\u2019s intervention, he said. High Court President Mr Justice David Barniville thanked the joint administrators for making the reports publicly available with very light redactions for commercial sensitivity.

However, it could not access the preceding 22 setting out detailed costs of the company\u2019s administration. When previously contacted by the paper, Grant Thornton and its lawyers said they could not release the records, instead suggesting the documents \u201cshould be available\u201d by asking the court. The Courts Service said it does not keep possession of documents, such as these reports, that are submitted as exhibits. The Irish Times then applied to the High Court President, who last week said the court had \u201cno hesitation\u201d in providing the reports, subject to any redactions necessary for protecting privileged information. The records \u201cshould be publicly available\u201d, he said. Mr Corkery last week said his clients had \u201cno objection in principle\u201d to releasing the reports but needed some time to review them as they were initially provided to the court on a confidential basis for reasons of commercial sensitivity.",

            "raw_text": "Insurance reformers and politicians challenged a deal by regulators to allow motor underwriters appoint their own independent experts to oversee compliance with competition law. Motor insurers AIG, Allianz, Axa, Aviva, FBD and broker AA Ireland have agreed with State regulators to improve their compliance with competition rules following an investigation into suspected price manipulation. However, news that the settlement with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) allows the companies to appoint their own independent experts to ensure they are adhering to the deal has drawn criticism. Peter Boland, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, warned that agreement \"did not inspire any confidence\" in the outcome of a process undermined by the weakness of the CCPC and Central Bank in protecting consumers. Pearse Doherty, Sinn F\u00e9in's spokesman on finance, argued that allowing the insurers to appoint their own external competition law experts to oversee compliance called into question the agreement's effectiveness. He claimed the agreement exposed the weakness of the CCPC and its powers, adding that the commission\u2019s decision not to take legal action was deeply regrettable. Mr Doherty said that when lobby group Insurance Ireland \u201cboasted\u201d that none of the companies were found to have broken competition law, it forgot to mention that the CCPC had no power in this instance to make such a finding or issue any fine. \u201cThe Government would also like the public to remain ignorant of the fact that the CCPC has called for these powers for a decade, and that the Government has missed a February deadline to transpose an EU directive that would provide for many of these powers,\u201d Mr Doherty said. He noted that the Bill, which will give the commission the powers it seeks should it become law, had not been published. The CCPC confirmed on Monday that the agreement obliged the six businesses to appoint their own independent experts to oversee their compliance programmes. However, the CCPC disagreed that it called into question the independence of the oversight. \u201cNot only is the oversight external to the parties but, importantly, an annual submission must be filed with the CCPC, to confirm compliance with the commitments,\u201d said the regulator. Additional information The organisation added that it could demand additional information from each of the parties at any time to verify that they were upholding their side of the settlement. \u201cIf the CCPC feels any of the parties are not fulfilling the requirements of their commitment agreement, it may be considered a breach of the agreement and the CCPC can take legal proceedings against the party,\u201d the commission pointed out. Regulators investigated suspected \u201cprice signalling\u201d. This is where rival companies let each other know in advance that they are increasing charges, potentially prompting further price hikes across their industry. Detailed public announcements by motor insurers of pending price increases in 2015 and 2016 sparked the inquiry. All the companies denied that they had engaged in anti-competitive behaviour. The six businesses have agreed to appoint internal compliance officers who will investigate potential breaches of competition law and report to their boards. Among other steps, they must put systems in place to detect any likely infringements.",

            "raw_text": "The cost of health insurance for a family of four climbed by around \u20ac500 last year when compared with 2022, according to a new report from the health insurance watchdog. It also notes that older people are typically paying almost 50 per cent more for cover than younger cohorts The 2023 market report from the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) also shows that while nearly one in two Irish people have health insurance, the pace at which people are taking out cover has slowed since 2022. The average cost of health insurance has increased by 10 per cent since 2022 to \u20ac1,594 with price increases throughout 2023 by all three health insurers. Alongside the cost-of-living crisis, the HIA said it suggested that a lack of affordability is the main reason for the slowing growth in the number of people buying health insurance. The research shows that people over the age of 65 are paying 43 per cent more on average for health insurance, with the higher cost of orthopaedic and joint replacement cover one of the main reasons for the higher premiums. Two-thirds of the over-65s are on high orthopaedic cover compared with only 27 per cent of those under the age of 65. Just under three-quarters of the under-65s are on restricted orthopaedic cover which would see them cover a portion of the bill should they require such care. A total of 47 per cent of the population have health insurance although that number has increased by just 1.6 per cent since 2022. While there are 350 plans and three insurers in the health insurance markets, half of all customers have singed up to fewer than 10 per cent of the plans on offer. The total premium income for the three health insurers is \u20ac3.2 billion and a 15 per cent increase in claims since 2022. Hospital day admissions continued to increase at a faster rate than overnight stays last year \u201cThis annual market report informs the HIA, the regulator for private health insurance, as to the state of play in the market,\u201d said the chief executive of the HIA Ray Dolan. \u201cIt is very useful to see the landscape of the sector and means we are able to assess and monitor trends in the industry and inform policy on that basis.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

            "raw_text": "It\u2019s a curious thing that the competition authority and the insurance industry were claiming a triumph of sorts last week following a five-year investigation into alleged price signalling by the insurers. On one side, the Consumer and Competition Protection Commission (CCPC) announced that it had secured legally binding commitments from six leading motor insurers in the Irish market to \u201creform their internal competition law compliance programmes\u201d. In September 2020, the CCPC issued preliminary findings from its investigation alleging that the insurers had engaged in anti-competitive co-operation over a 21-month period during 2015 and 2016, via price signalling. All of the insurers denied that they were in breach of competition law. The insurers in question were AIG, Allianz, AXA, Aviva, FBD and AA Ireland, and they have agreed to independent oversight of their competition compliance programmes. It sounded like a victory for the CCPC when it was announced last Thursday, although questions are now being asked about how \u201cindependent\u201d this oversight will be. On the other side, Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of industry group Insurance Ireland, said its members had \u201cconstructively engaged\u201d with the CCPC throughout this process, and proudly noted that \u201cno breaches of competition law were found\u201d. Murdock said the implementation of these \u201ccompliance reforms\u201d by its members demonstrated a \u201ccommitment to competition law compliance, which... supports markets to operate in a fair and competitive way and ultimately for the benefit of consumers\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty described it as boasting by the industry and lamented the fact that the CCPC did not take legal actions against the insurers. You would have to wonder why the insurers agreed to sign up to legally binding agreements with the CCPC if they hadn\u2019t broken the law. Brokers Ireland was also captured by this investigation but steadfastly refused to sign up to the agreement with the commission, insisting that it hadn\u2019t broken the law. It faces no further action as the investigation is now closed. \u201cThe nature of the CCPC processes raises concerns especially where, as here, preliminary findings were issued and the CCPC didn\u2019t respond to detailed submissions on these findings,\u201d Diarmuid Kelly, chief executive of Brokers Ireland said, adding that the compliance framework sought by the commission has essentially been in place at his organisation since 2017. The real winners in this arrangement between the CCPC and the insurers are the auditors and accountants who will be remunerated to provide these reports, which must be submitted annually to the CCPC. This will be another cost to insurers, and one that will be passed on to motorists. What this case has highlighted is the inadequacy of the CCPC\u2019s powers, something that was acknowledged in its statement last week. Current legislation only allows a fine to be imposed by the courts for a criminal breach of competition law, unlike in most other EU countries. The CCPC\u2019s powers in relation to non-criminal breaches are \u201climited and do not pose a significant deterrent\u201d, as noted by law firm Beauchamps in an advisory to clients in January. The CCPC can only seek commitments from a business that they will cease the practice and obtain an injunction against them doing the same action again. Change This is set to change with the anticipated enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Bill, which will transpose an EU directive into Irish law. The new Bill will ensure that fines can be imposed for non-criminal breaches of EU competition law, along with a raft of other powers. All is not well in the Irish insurance industry. We should be concerned that this is the third investigation by the CCPC into the sector in recent years. This latest one has prompted the commission to write to the Central Bank of Ireland \u2013 the insurance sector\u2019s financial regulator. The CCPC said it was not giving the industry a \u201cclean bill of health\u201d and that its letter to the Central Bank has outlined \u201cbroader cultural concerns in the industry which have come to light during the course of the investigation\u201d, adding that it was available to assist in any look into \u201cwider cultural issues in the financial services sector\u201d. In June, the European Commission informed Insurance Ireland of its preliminary view that it breached EU antitrust rules by restricting competition in the Irish motor insurance market, in relation to certain conditions of access to a data sharing system, which Insurance Ireland administers. That same month the Central Bank proposed to ban home and motor insurance companies from imposing so-called loyalty penalties on long-standing customers. We have also seen the collapse of a number of insurers, including Quinn, Setanta and Enterprise, which disrupted the market and pushed added costs onto consumers here. RSA was the biggest player in the market until a major accounting scandal emerged in 2013 and it required a \u20ac423 million injection of cash from its parent group to shore up its balance sheet. Whether it\u2019s the Central Bank or the CCPC or both, it is long past time for a deeper dive into the workings and culture of the Irish insurance industry.",

            "raw_text": "LHK Group, the Leinster-based insurance and financial planning broker, has moved to acquire two smaller Dublin peers, Richardson Insurance Solutions and The Insurance Shop, for undisclosed sums. It is understood that the deals will increase the gross annual premiums written by LHK, a third-generation family-owned business run by managing director Colm Kelleher, by about a third to \u20ac40 million. Established in 1938, they are one of the oldest brokers on the island of Ireland and act for owner-managers, entrepreneurs, sole traders, partnerships and family businesses. Richardson Insurance Solutions, led by Derek Richardson, specialises in providing cover within niche markets such as leisure, hospitality, motor caravans, salons and trades insurance. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and will see all of Richardson Insurance's 10-strong team join LHK. Headcount of 46 LHK also recently acquired The Insurance Shop, a three-person operation, that has traditionally focused on coverage for retail shops. LHK\u2019s headcount will rise to 46 as a result of both deals. \u201cIn an era of increased foreign ownership of Irish brokers, we see our position in the market, as a locally owned and managed broker, being a key differentiator in an increasingly consolidated market,\u201d Mr Kelleher said. The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past five years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms. Fee-based business The attraction for financial investors lies in the fact that insurance broking is a fee-based business that delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle, and strong cash flows that allow buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. The most active dealmaker in recent times has been Arachas, whose name is Irish for insurance. Arachas itself was acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a private equity-backed UK brokerage group. UK-based insurance intermediary PIB Group moved last year to buy three Irish brokerages, including Wexford-based Campion Insurance. Elsewhere, private-equity firm MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland has dived into the broker space in recent years using a vehicle called Innovu to mop up a series of businesses.",

            "date": "2023-01-30",
            "raw_text": "News that health insurance premiums are climbing after more than two years of price stability will not be welcomed by just under 2.5 million policy holders across the State \u2013 but the increases have looked on the cards for some time. Over the past 12 months the healthcare sector has faced similar input cost increases as those fuelling the cost-of-living crisis elsewhere. That pressure comes on top of medical inflation which \u2013 driven by new technology and drug costs \u2013 has been consistently climbing faster than general rates of inflation. While price hikes of about 5 per cent announced by Irish Life and the VHI in recent weeks \u2013 with Laya Healthcare almost certain to follow suit \u2013 will see the annual cost of a typical policy climb by about \u00a475; older people, those with the highest levels of cover, will end up paying substantially more. Speaking to this newspaper, the chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), Laura Brien, noted that the over-65s pay 40-45 per cent more for health insurance than the younger section of the population. Some of that is down to choice, with many older people opting to pay more to insure they have better benefits at a stage in their lives when they fear they might have to lean more heavily on the healthcare system. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Some is down to the peculiarities of the health system which allow those with health insurance not only to access a higher level of comfort in hospital, but also to get necessary and essential assessment and treatment in a timely fashion. In some cases, higher prices are being paid by those who can ill-afford them and who are doing so through a combination of fear, confusion and inertia. A chronic hospital overcrowding crisis and a public system under enormous strain has frightened many into paying whatever it takes to get access to private healthcare. And given the length of the queues to access some basic diagnostic facilities and treatments on the public system, this is entirely understandable. There are also hundreds of thousands of people paying over the odds by not proactively seeking the best value. According to the HIA, plans on the market for more than three years cost, on average, 25 per cent more than newer plans. Many on older plans could easily find comparable cover for much less than they currently pay. Despite the potential savings, about 1.5 million people rarely or never switch so effectively giving insurance companies money for nothing. The health insurers do not make this easy for consumers either \u2013 with a bewildering array of plans and options on offer, often poorly explained. Many customers are due to have their policies renewed in the weeks ahead \u2013 so the time to act and seek the best policy is now, or pay the price in the year ahead.",

            "title": "Health insurance matters \u2013 even in the days of premium refunds",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2021-01-18",
            "raw_text": "The year just past managed to perform a neat trick by simultaneously proving the importance and irrelevance of private health insurance. With the public health system coming under unimaginable strain as Covid-19 took hold, people in the fortunate position of being able to afford health insurance continued to have access to private hospitals, consultants and clinics and could avail of treatment for a wide range of conditions on both an in-patient and out-patient basis. As long as they didn\u2019t want access to any of those services in April, May and June when almost the entire network of private hospitals was effectively subsumed into the public system in order to cater for a much feared, but thankfully avoided, surge in Covid-19 cases at the outset of the pandemic. It was avoided then but who knows might happen in the days and weeks ahead. As a result of measures taken last spring, the three main players in the health insurance space \u2013 the VHI, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health \u2013 were forced to offer substantial refunds in recognition of the fact that much of what their customers were paying for was unavailable. Last month the VHI announced it planned to waive a further portion of premiums as a result of a drop in claims due to Covid-19 with adults due \u20ac75 back and a family of four set to receive \u20ac200 as a rebate later this month. But while the health insurance sector was and continues to be in a state of flux the like of which could scarcely have been imagined this time last year, it remains a fact that health insurance matters. It is also true that many of the 2 million or so people in Ireland with health insurance are heading into the busiest renewal period of the year and most of them will simply allow their policy to be renewed without asking too many questions of their provider. And once you miss the renewal window you are locked in for another 12 months. People will stick with their providers despite the fact that if they have not reviewed their health insurance policy in the last three years they will almost certainly be wasting money by staying where they are. Switching insurers can seem daunting not least because there are currently 314 different products on the market and choosing between them can be overwhelming but making a bit of effort now could easily save readers of this page hundreds of euro this year and next without the loss of any cover. Premium rise The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) says that more than a million people are due to renew their health insurance in the first three months of 2021 and consumers with policies almost certainly face another strong single-digit rise in premiums, according to benefits consultants Willis Towers Watson. In a report released late last year the consultants predicted prices in Ireland will climb by between 5 per cent and 7 per cent in part due to the impact of Covid-19. That increase will come on the back of an average rise of 5 per cent in 2020 and 4.5 per cent in 2019. Costs are rising for a range of factors \u2013 the increasing costs of treatment, ageing populations, and advancements in medical technology while the financial impact of the pandemic on healthcare providers is another factor, requiring increased numbers of medical staff, new procedures and PPE costs. Rising costs are one reason why the switching market should be busy but it won\u2019t be largely as a result of fear and confusion. With so many plans on the market it is a hard sector to navigate and many people opt to choose the devil they know rather than risking a loss of cover by making a switch. Unlike many other areas of the switching market, making a mistake might actually be a matter of life or death \u2013 or at least that is how many people see it. Switching is not, however, that hard. Amongst the first things to remember is that people cannot be penalised based on their age and health and all plans have to be made available to everyone. And nor can companies pry into your state of wellbeing. When making inquiries they can really only ask you the following three questions: Who are you currently insured with? What plan are you on? And how long have you been on that plan? Once you already have a policy, pre-existing conditions don\u2019t even come in to it and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re planning to have a double hip replacement tomorrow, you can switch from insurer A to insurer B today, and insurer B becomes liable for the cost of the procedure as long as you had cover for it with your previous insurer. If you move from one insurer to another a new company must also give you full credit for all time spent with other insurers and they cannot penalise you for prior claims. If you are switching to an equivalent plan, then you are fully covered immediately; if you upgrade your cover, then the additional benefits may not kick in for a period. Dermot Goode is a health insurance expert with totalhealthcover.ie and he stresses the importance of switching or at least looking at alternatives before renewal. He points out that, as with car and home insurance, \"you can switch back to your previous insurer again next year if you're not happy with the new provider\". Rules of thumb He has some simple rules of thumb to work out if people are at least potentially over-paying for cover. Among the red flags he identifies are policies which cost more than \u20ac1,800 per adult. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the same plan for three years or more or you have all the family on the same plan,\u201d is another warning sign. He also says people should make sure they are on an up-to-date corporate plan and not to be on a dated cover. He also identifies some such policies: VHI Health Plus Extra, Family Plan Plus Level 1, Parent & Kids Option, Laya Essential Plus, Flex 125 Explore, Company Care Premium and Irish Life Healthcare's Level 2 Hospital, Business Plan Complete and Business Plan Extra. Among the other reasons Goode identifies as a reason for people to review their cover is if their plan is being retired \u2013 in this year\u2019s case by the VHI. Among the plans it is phasing out are Health Plus Choice and Forward plan. He also says some VHI benefits are being reduced and may offer less psychiatric cover on certain plans while some Laya plans now include a 20 per cent shortfall on 13 restricted orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures. He identifies .360 Care, 360 Care Select, Connect Choice, Care Select, Health Secure Plus but there are more. He also says people should look to see if they are getting guaranteed refunds on out-patient expenses with no excess to pay. The HIA website hia.ie should be the first stop. It has details of every plan on the market and a comparison tool that lets you see how your existing plan stacks up against other policies. Brokers are also worth considering. We asked Goode for some specific policy recommendations but it is important to remember they should be considered a starting point for your own research and not an end point. For an adult willing to pay about \u20ac1,200 he suggested the VHI\u2019s snappily named PMI 5210 which costs \u20ac1,193, Laya Healthcare\u2019s Inspire policy at \u20ac1,165 and Irish Life Healthcare\u2019s 4D Health 1 which costs \u20ac1,176. Goode says these policies \"cover all public and standard private hospitals up to semi-private level with each claim in private hospitals subject to a small excess of \u20ac150-\u20ac200 per claim\". They have limited cover for the high-tech hospitals, such as the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private, and although the VHI and Laya plans include guaranteed refunds on eligible out-patient costs, the Irish Life Health plan includes a free personalised package but no guaranteed out-patient refunds. The plans also include small excesses per private hospital admission and may include co-payments on certain orthopaedic/ophthalmic procedures. It is also worth noting that, while the prices are broadly comparable, that does not mean the policies are like-for-like in every respect which is why it is always worth looking closely at the benefits to make sure they work for you. For someone willing to pay a bit more \u2013 between \u20ac1,350 and \u20ac1,400 \u2013 he listed three further policies. First was VHI\u2019s PMI 3613 which costs \u20ac1,358 followed by Laya Healthcare\u2019s Simply Connect Plus at \u20ac1,407 and then Irish Life Healthcare\u2019s 4D Health 2 at \u20ac1,361. There plans cover up to semi-private in private hospitals subject to a small excess per claim of \u20ac75- \u20ac150 per claim. They also offer limited cover for the high-tech hospitals and offer guaranteed refunds on a range of eligible out-patient expenses with no excess to pay first. Most of the refunds are in the order of 50 per cent. Too many people 'have little or no idea what they're actually covered for'   Barbara Sheahan, the managing director of HealthCareCompare.ie, says she often finds that \"people are unfamiliar with the terminology around health insurance and lack awareness into what benefits and coverage they could be entitled to with a different plan\". She says that means too many people \u201chave little or no idea what they\u2019re actually covered for\u201d and with about two-thirds of people likely to make a claim at some point many \u201ccould face some unwelcome surprises if [they] need treatment, only to find it\u2019s not covered by [their] policy.\u201d She points out over the past year \u201cpersonal circumstances have changed massively for many of us: a lot of people have lost their jobs and may now be struggling to make repayments for their insurance\u201d but stresses there are \u201ca number of ways you can reduce costs without needing to cancel your health insurance altogether\u201d. She encourages people to speak with a health insurance broker each year before deciding to renew existing policies. \u201cThere may be alternative plans available to suit your needs \u2013 and your budget \u2013 better than your current plan. There may also have been changes to your current plan over the past 12 months.\u201d She cites the example of Laya which has introduced co-payments for orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures on several of their plans. \u201c360 Care was a popular plan covering these procedures last year and now has a 20 per cent shortfall. Company Care Plus covers these procedures and has no excesses.\u201d She also suggest applying an excess to a plan can help reduce premium costs. \u201cThese excesses only apply to private hospitals and most plans offer excesses on a per stay basis, rather than per night. Generally speaking, higher excesses mean lower annual premiums.\u201d And as we have done on many occasions she points to the benefit of the corporate plan. \u201cMany people are unaware they can access corporate plans as an individual \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need to be through your employer or on a group basis. These plans are usually released for large corporate clients and will often offer the best value for money. Legally, all plans must be made available to everyone. \u201cHowever, insurers are not obliged to tell customers about these plans. Because such plans often have confusing names, they can be hard to find and off-putting for individuals.\u201d She also tells younger people to get insured before their 35th birthday. \u201cWhen you take out health insurance at the age of 34 or younger, you only need to pay your premium. But if you\u2019re purchasing health insurance for the first time after your 35th birthday, you will have to pay a \u2018lifetime community rating\u2019 loading.\u201d And the older you are the more you will pay. Panel : Will someone think of the children? Given that there is free GP care for children up to the age of six and no children\u2019s hospitals in the private system in Ireland, one long-standing question many people have is whether they need to pay health insurance premiums for their offspring at all. While it may not make sense to get them the same level of cover adults might get, if you can afford it, it can prove to be a great comfort, both financially and psychologically. Children who fall ill tend to be typically treated in public hospitals, but many private hospitals will treat children as young as four and five for day procedures and having health insurance allows parents to circumvent the public queues, however unpalatable that may sound on the broadest of levels. The Beacon Hospital in Dublin has a paediatric service which offers day-care and overnight procedures, covering general surgery, urology, dentistry and ophthalmology while the Mater Private has a team of paediatric consultants, surgeons and anaesthetists. But while cover may be useful, the trick is to look at the cheaper policies offering cover for private hospitals unless your child has specific healthcare needs. While policies for children start at around \u20ac130 a year, cover for both public and private hospitals will likely not kick in unless people pay between \u20ac200 and \u20ac250. One area where private health insurance can come into its own is with vaccinations. Most critical vaccinations are taken care of by the State when children are infants but elective vaccines, such as the one for chickenpox or Meningitis B (which was only introduced as standard for children in 2016) cost between \u20ac140 and \u20ac300. A good health insurance plan for children will cover between \u20ac30 and \u20ac60 of the vaccination cost. Panel:  Top tips to switch and save   Don\u2019t leave it until the last minute and shop around well in advance of renewal or have a trusted family member or friend help you. The savings could reach \u20ac1,000 each year depending on the plan held. While comparison websites are a useful guide, they are only that. If in doubt, seek independent advice and let someone else do the heavy lifting for you. Don\u2019t be afraid to switch. It\u2019s just an insurance policy and if you ask the right questions and you\u2019re happy with the answers, switch and save. There is no reward for loyalty in health insurance. Split your cover and consider the needs of each person on the policy and insure them on whatever plan matches those needs. You don\u2019t need to have everyone on the same plan or even insured with the same insurer. Check out the special offers, such as free cover for children under 18 with one insurer. Check out the corporate schemes which are available from each insurer as they include guaranteed refunds on eligible out-patient expenses which is not included on many dated schemes. Remember, you can join any plan on the market. Still not sure you\u2019re on the right plan; just phone your insurer and ask them if they have a lower-cost equivalent to your existing plan. What you are looking for is a similar benefit plan at a lower cost. You can also put the same question to the other insurers as well before you renew. Have them check all their plans, especially their best corporate plans. If it is the case then make sure the insurer knows that you don\u2019t mind taking on a small excess to reduce the cost. Do everything over the phone and whatever alternatives they suggest, have them confirm what you are losing and gaining. Disclose everything to them in terms of existing conditions and likely treatment to get specific answers to all your queries. Ignore any items that are on the plan which may not apply to you such as maternity, psychiatric, convalescence, etc. By law they must be included on all plans. And if you\u2019re able to generate some savings, consider topping up your cover with a DeCare Dental plan or a cash plan from HSF Health Plan.",

            "raw_text": "A five-year extension of a State-backed subsidy scheme worth hundreds of millions of euro to the health insurance sector has been given the green light by the European Commission. The Commission confirmed on Thursday that it had approved the extension and modification of Ireland\u2019s risk equalisation scheme that compensates insurers for the provision of private medical insurance. Under the scheme, health insurers, whose customers have a higher risk profile than the market average, obtain payments from a risk equalisation fund. The \u20ac760 million fund is financed via a duty imposed on all private health insurers. While any operator can benefit from the fund and all operators pay into it, in practice, the state-owned insurer, VHI Insurance, is a net beneficiary of the scheme while its competitors are expected to be net contributors. The VHI benefits most because of its disproportionately large share of older and sicker customers. Equal access to insurance The aim of the scheme is to ensure that access to health insurance is available to consumers of health services with no differentiation made between them based on for example health risk status, age or sex. All customers on a given health plan pay the same premium regardless of health history or any other factor. The scheme was first granted EU approval in 2003. It has been extended on four subsequent occasions but was set to expire this week. It has been modified to include a \u201chigh cost claims pool\u201d, where the amount of a claim in excess of \u20ac50,000 will be reimbursed at 40 per cent. All other claims will continue to be reimbursed based on age of the insured person and the number of days/nights spent in a hospital. There will also be an increase from 4.4 per cent to 6 per cent in the return on sales made by the net beneficiary of the scheme on the basis of the sales of private health insurance service the prolongation of the scheme until the end of March 2027. The Commission assessed the proposed modifications under the EU state aid rules and, in particular, the EU framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation. It found that, following the modifications, the scheme remains in line with EU state aid rules. On this basis, the Commission approved the modifications and the prolonging of the scheme under EU state aid rules.",

            "date": "2023-08-30",
            "raw_text": "The State\u2019s largest private health insurer  VHI  has announced that its prices are to increase by an average of 7 per cent with effect from the beginning October. It is the second price increase the provider has imposed in 2023. In March, the company, which has more than 1.1 million subscribers, said it would increase prices by an average of 4.8 per cent across its health insurance plans due to increased demand for healthcare and rising costs. While the company stressed that the average increase would be 7 per cent certain policies will climb by 9 per cent which will see some people paying hundreds of euro more each year for their health insurance. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 The price hike will put further pressure on households dealing with cost-of-living increases. The second hike in little more than six months means  hundreds of thousands of its customers will be facing double digit price hikes  amounting to hundreds of euro between now and the end of February. The company blamed a \u201ccontinuous increase in the numbers of members accessing healthcare as well as sustained increases in the costs associated with the delivery of healthcare are driving the need for a price increase\u201d. In a statement, VHI said it had a responsibility to set premiums in a prudent and sustainable manner to ensure that VHI can provide its members with access to excellent healthcare and meet those costs. Speaking about the increases in premium Aaron Keogh, managing director, VHI Insurance DAC said: \u201cWe are conscious of the financial pressures that many of our members are facing, however, the price increase is necessary to ensure that we continue to meet member\u2019s healthcare needs. The pandemic brought significant impacts on healthcare delivery in Ireland but we have seen a strong recovery in the number of members accessing necessary healthcare treatments in all parts of the healthcare system through 2023. [\u00a0 A guide to health insurance for first-timers or under 40s \u00a0] \u201cAs well as a sustained rise in the volume of claims, there have been significant increases in the costs associated with the delivery of healthcare due to upward pressure on wages, energy and other costs. This price increase is necessary to ensure that we continue to meet the healthcare needs of our customers, giving them access to new and innovative drugs, procedures, technologies and services as required to meet their medical needs now and into the future.\u201d He said the company \u201cexists solely to meet the healthcare needs of our members and all premium income received is used solely for this purpose. Any surplus generated is invested in improving the service experience and healthcare outcomes of our members\u201d. Responding to the latest increase the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) said it had been given the legally required 30 days notice of the hike. \u201cThe private health insurance market in Ireland gives discretion to health insurers to set the prices for their policies,\u201d the HIA said in a statement. \u201cThese prices are ultimately based on the cost of the claims that the insurers receive. If the number of claims or the cost of healthcare increases, prices can also increase. \u201cDue to medical inflation and an increase in claims volume since the COVID-19 pandemic, insurers have effected a number of price increases this year. This trend is consistent with an emerging global pattern post- COVID. \u201cWe always encourage consumers to review their policy each year at their renewal date to ensure that their policy fits their health needs and budget. Consumers can use the free comparison tool on our website,  hia.ie , to find the best policy for their needs.\u201d",

            "date": "2021-03-10",
            "raw_text": "The Cabinet has approved the introduction of new personal injury guidelines designed to tackle high insurance claims. The move will mean amending the Judicial Council Act and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act. The guidelines are due to come in to force from next month. Announcing the Government approval on Tuesday, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said she believed the \u201ccorrect balance\u201d had been struck between combating high insurance costs and safeguarding both injured parties and those who need to defend claims. \u201cI hope the new guidelines will have an impact on the award of damages in personal injuries cases and bring down the cost of insurance. We\u2019ll continue to assess the impact of the guidelines and if we need to take further action, we will,\u201d she said. The guidelines set out the level of damages that may be awarded or assessed in respect of personal injuries. Judges voted to adopt the new guidelines at a meeting last Saturday. The majority of Judicial Council members, 146 of 168, participated in the virtual meeting and 83 voted in favour, and 63 voted against, the guidelines. The guidelines will replace the Book of Quantum, which set general guidelines for the amounts to be awarded or assessed in personal injury claims. While the courts will retain independence and discretion when awarding general damages, it will be mandatory for judges to assess damages having regard to the guidelines and they will have to specify, in judgments, their reasons for any departure from them. The guidelines propose a modest increase in awards for the catastrophically injured, with the maximum general damages for such injuries to be increased from \u20ac500,000 to \u20ac550,000. The aim is to ensure awards for lesser injuries are proportionate to that maximum. In the case of a simple non-displaced nose fracture with a full recovery for example, the guidelines provide for an award of between \u20ac500-\u20ac3,000, when the Book of Quantum provides for between \u20ac18,000-\u20ac21,000. The guidelines provide for damages of \u20ac17,500 to \u20ac27,500 for the total loss of a ring finger and between \u20ac10,000-\u20ac17,500 for its partial loss. The Book of Quantum provides for up to \u20ac57,200 for total loss and up to \u20ac43,300 for partial loss. A big toe amputation would attract damages of between \u20ac28,000-\u20ac45,000 under the guidelines while the Book of Quantum provides for up to \u20ac70,600. The guidelines will apply to applications already made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), except where an assessment has been made. The Book of Quantum will continue to apply where PIAB assessments have been made or where a hearing is already before the courts.",

            "raw_text": "Jim Campion seems to have caught himself off guard by how he's dealing with the agreed sale, announced on Monday, of his Campion Insurance brokers business to UK-based insurance intermediary PIB Group. \u201cThe last week has been a little bit emotional, with all kinds of things going through one\u2019s mind,\u201d Campion said on a joint video call with his new boss, PIB chief Brendan McManus. \u201cIt was a family business. We made all the decisions for the past 37 years and you feel it\u2019s the end of that chapter. But we\u2019re now starting another one. We\u2019re really excited about the future.\u201d Founded in 1984 by the businessman and his wife, Margaret, as a small outfit in Urlingford, Co Kilkenny, the business has become one of the largest brokers in the Irish market, with 180 staff across 12 offices, writing about \u20ac80 million of gross premiums. Commercial insurance makes up half its business, with personal coverage 35 per cent and the remainder in financial services, mainly life insurance and pensions. Industry sources have put the deal at more than \u20ac70 million, about 10 times its estimated \u20ac7 million current annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). The Campions are understood to be taking a small stake in PIB as part payment. PIB Group entered the Irish wholesale insurance market in late 2017 through the purchase of Citynet Insurance Brokers, a Lloyd\u2019s of London broker operating in the UK and Irish market. It followed up in 2019 with the purchase of another wholesale intermediary, Optis Insurance. It entered the Irish retail market in April with the purchase of Wexford-based broker Creane & Creane Insurance and followed up last month with the agreed purchase of Waterford-based Oliver Murphy Insurance. \u201cBut the business that we really wanted to invest in was Jim\u2019s business because we think that is a fantastic platform in Ireland, and a fantastic platform to embark on an even more ambitious programme of investment,\u201d said McManus. The Campion founder and his management team are staying on. \u201cI turned 60 this year. Every time I pass a nought I believe I should re-evaluate life,\u201d said Campion. \u201cBut I will be around here for six, seven years, or maybe more. While I feel I can add value to the business I have no problem in working away.\u201d Flurry of deals Campion, one of the largest independent brokers in the State, is the latest to be caught up in a flurry of deals across the industry over the past five years, belatedly following waves of consolidation in other markets, not least in the UK. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private-equity firms, sitting on a wall of cash in an era of cheap and easy money. However, some, such as Conor Brennan, chief executive of Arachas Corporate Brokers, one of the most acquisitive Irish broker groups in recent years, are beginning to call time on the current wave of deals. He says valuations have got out of hand \u2013 especially as market interest rates are beginning to push higher in anticipation of central-bank moves to rein in global inflation, which has reared its head this year. PIB Group was set up in 2015 with the backing of US investment giant Carlyle Group and embarked on a drive of more than 30 acquisitions before London-based private-equity firm Apax Partners took a controlling stake in the business earlier this year. The attraction for private equity is obvious: insurance broking is a fee-based business that delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle, and strong cash flows that allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. Sectoral consolidation among top-tier global corporate insurance brokers has also been a major theme in recent years. New York-based Marsh McLennan purchased UK peer Jardine Lloyd Thompson for $5.7 billion in 2019. In July, Aon, which is registered in Dublin but run out of London, and Irish-domiciled Willis Towers Watson planned a $30 billion (\u20ac26.2 billion) tie-up that would have created the world's biggest insurance broker but that was abandoned after the US government sued to block the combination. Willis Towers Watson was formed through a $18 billion merger in 2016. Private-equity investors \u201cPrivate-equity investors see insurance distribution almost as an annuity business,\u201d says McManus. \u201cEven in the depths of Covid, people still had to renew their insurance policies, they had to insure their properties or their vehicles. Those private-equity businesses that haven\u2019t got an insurance broker in their asset base would really love one right now.\u201d Owners of brokers, on the other hand, have been tempted by the strong valuations being achieved in the industry, amid issues over succession planning in many businesses, and the prospects of scale offering opportunities for back-office and compliance savings in an era of growing regulation. Brokers Ireland, the industry representative body for insurance and financial intermediaries, estimates that insurance brokers account for 340 of the organisation's 1,200 members. Its director of general insurance, Cathie Shannon, says \"over-regulation\" of the sector and well-aired difficulties that brokers have had in securing liability insurance capacity in recent years in the areas of leisure and hospitality has also been weighing on members. \u201cAnd as a representative body what we want to see is proportionate regulation which protects consumers but also takes account the low level of systemic risk that we\u2019re exposed to,\u201d said Shannon. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the volume of regulation. It\u2019s the fact that new regulation is coming along all the time, with very little regard for what\u2019s already in place. That\u2019s a very significant burden, particularly on smaller groups with fewer staff members.\u201d Dealmaker The most active dealmaker in recent times has been Arachas, whose name is Irish for insurance. Established in 2003 through the merger of Cork-based broker Tyrrell Coakley with two Dublin-based peers, Hodgins Percival and Slattery Jermyn, the company ramped up acquisitions in the wake of a management buyout deal backed by UK private-equity firm Sovereign Capital in 2017. The Irish brokerage group was itself snapped up last year by larger UK peer Ardonagh Group \u2013 itself backed by US private-equity houses HPS Investment Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners \u2013 for about \u20ac250 million. The transaction was based on a multiple of 14.5 times ebitda, according to industry sources, due to its position in the market and platform. Arachas has continued, since its takeover, to mop up brokers, including education, sports and events specialist O'Driscoll O'Neil and Waterford-based Hooper Dolan, with the consideration for the latter believed to be more than \u20ac60 million. Arachas now writes close to \u20ac360 million of premiums in the Irish market. Private-equity firm MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland has also dived into the broker space in recent years using a vehicle called Innovu, initially to take a stake of about 75 per cent in Sheridan Insurances in early 2019. It has gone on to wrap up four other purchases, including Wexford Insurances, one of the State's leading equestrian insurance brokerages, and Goggin Insurance Brokers in Munster. Innovu now has more than 140 staff and expects total written premiums for the year to come to about \u20ac67 million. The group, led by chief executive Ronan Foley, has stated that it wants to grow over the long term to become a business with \u20ac250 million-\u20ac300 million of premiums. British broker Aston Lark also got in on the action in 2019, buying Dublin-based Robertson Low, which was established in 1995 and was Ireland's first fully licensed Lloyd's broker, and Wexford-based Wright Insurance Brokers. It has used the merged entity Aston Lark Ireland to carry out a slew of acquisitions, including seven so far this year. Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs took control of the wider Aston Lark group in 2019, before agreeing last month the sell it to Howden, an international insurance broking group, for a reported \u00a31.1 billion (\u20ac1.3 billion). Elsewhere, UK private-equity firm Livingbridge acquired a majority stake in Chill Insurance last year in a deal that is said to have valued the Irish business at up to \u20ac100 million. Broking business At the other end of the scale, fledgling Irish private-equity firm Melior Equity Partners ventured into the broking business over the summer for its first investment, taking a majority stake in Dublin-based BHP Insurance, which specialises in covering not-for-profit organisations. The deal helped BHP acquire another broker, Keegan Meredith & Williams Insurances. Melior co-founder Peter Garvey is no stranger to the industry, having previously worked for the Carlyle Group, where he led the Carlyle Cardinal Ireland Fund's 2016 purchase of roadside assistance and insurance intermediary company AA Ireland. He managed the fund's subsequent sale of AA Ireland last year \u2013 in a deal worth more than \u20ac240 million \u2013 to Further Global Capital Management, a US private-equity fund led by former French president Nicolas Sarkozy's half-brother. \u201cDespite the consolidation that has gone on, the industry still remains fragmented. Our research shows that three-quarters of the owners of Irish brokers are over 50 years of age \u2013 and half of them are over 60. It\u2019s a demographic that\u2019s ageing and looking for solutions. That\u2019s driving a lot of [merger and acquisitions] activity,\u201d Garvey said. He said his firm is in talks on a \u201cnumber of bolt-on\u201d purchases. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit more flexible than potentially some of the larger consolidators in terms of deal structure. Some owners want to stay on and work for the next five or 10 years and work closely with their clients, but just want to de-risk at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in smaller brokers. Most of the big guys are not terribly interested in anything that is generating below \u20ac1 million in profits.\u201d Commissions For Peter Boland, director of Alliance for Insurance Reform, the raft of deals in the sector suggests that brokers are part of the problem, alongside insurers and lawyers, of the \"crippling costs\" of coverage in the State in recent times for business and households. \u201cIt would appear that brokers are doing exceptionally well out of the current crisis,\u201d said Boland. \u201cThe experience of our members during Covid has been that many stood full-square behind underwriters last year when their clients\u2019 business-interruption coverage claims were being denied. It was very clear that these brokers did not necessarily see their clients\u2019 interests as a priority but, rather, the commission check from underwriters. \u201cStill, it has to be said that there were honourable exceptions of those who backed their clients. \u201c Following on from landmark Irish and British court rulings earlier this year and pressure from the Central Bank for insurers to pay out on contracts where it was unclear whether businesses were covered for interruption as a result of Covid restrictions, underwriters operating in the Irish market had paid out \u20ac130 million on such claims as of the end of September. A Central Bank report in July on the public liability, employers\u2019 liability and commercial property insurance sectors showed that broker commissions had risen to the equivalent of 14 per cent of gross earned premiums in 2019 from 8 per cent in 2009. An earlier report on the motor sector pointed to a commission rate of 12 per cent in 2019. Brokers say they more than justify their fees due to the volume of work that now goes into researching the market for clients, preparing paper work on contracts, and dealing with regulation and compliance. \u201cIn addition, brokers now do a lot of the work that insurers would have traditionally attended to,\u201d said Shannon of Brokers Ireland. Back at Arachas, Brennan thinks that consolidation in the industry at a tipping point. \u201cI think the multiple inflation has reached a point where I think the first wave of consolidation is done and the market is probably at its hottest now,\u201d he said, referring to the fact that brokers are now being sold at between eight and 10 times ebitda, up from about five to six times five or six years ago. \"There aren't a huge amount of assets left to buy of size and scale. We're probably out of the Irish market now at this stage unless something really interesting comes along,\" said Brennan, who has been given the additional task at Ardonagh in recent months of scouting continental Europe for deals. \"The prices being paid now here are prohibitive from our perspective.\"",

Some product lines have remained stable, but overall the pandemic has had a devastating global effect says David Gallagher, lead underwriter at Hiscox Ireland, a specialist insurer that operates in niche sectors. \u201cAt Hiscox, we expect to pay globally $475 million in Covid-19 related claims net of reinsurance, the majority for event cancellation and travel insurance-related claims. In Ireland event cancellation claims surged in 2020, with hundreds cancelled around the country as per government advice. We reserved significant sums for this and with lockdowns continuing in 2021, new business premiums are non-existent with all physical events cancelled or on pause until restrictions are lifted and it is safe to resume them,\u201d Gallagher says. The majority of product lines were hit due to Covid-19 in various forms, however, remote working has had a positive impact on employers\u2019 liability (EL) and public liability (PL) insurance, which historically would see a very high frequency of claims activity in the Irish insurance market. \u201cSince March 2020, we have seen a reduction of 36 per cent in public liability and employers\u2019 liability claim notifications, which is likely due to the reduction in economic activity and mobility over the past 12 months \u2013 in particular during the first lockdown between March and June. \u201cHowever, it is assumed that this figure is likely to return to normal volumes as the economy recovers. Indeed, we saw a gradual return to normal PL and EL notifications over the summer months as the economy essentially opened back up in full. We have seen a smaller reduction in new EL and PL claim notifications since the second lockdown was announced in October,\u201d he says. Threat of cyberattacks Hiscox offer specialist cyber insurance \u2013 protection to companies that fall victim to cybercrime, which is a growing area and they are experiencing significantly more demand for this product \u2013 as the threat of cyberattacks continues to grow and evolve. Technology is another core sector they operate in and it has performed quite well in the pandemic due to most companies relying on technology to operate remotely. \u201cIt is still a very competitive marketplace and costs can be static here or may even reduce depending on the company\u2019s profile and activities. Any potential increased costs will more than likely be seen in the insurance- reinsurance company negotiations where they have their agreements in place. From a commercial/consumer perspective this will vary from insurer to insurer depending on the insurer\u2019s underwriting strategy, again depending on what sector and industries the insurer operate in,\u201d Gallagher says. Mark Kennedy, partner at Mazars says it is his sense that the pandemic isn't yet permanently amending the profile of individual insurance classes and that overall the sector has reacted well to the pandemic, switching to mobile working and continuing to serve clients well. \u201cHowever, sustained working in this model brings challenges and potentially is risky \u2013 a distributed environment potentially means changes to control frameworks, as well as posing a different kind of management challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cThe long-term impact is a little hard to determine at this point. In the shorter term many businesses will experience some cost duplication and increases. However, the longer term trends \u2013 in population behaviours, insurance events and perhaps even in interest rates may well be impacted by the pandemic,\u201d he adds. While Insurance Ireland does not yet have data on 2020, chief executive Moyagh Murdock says the general insurance market has been negatively affected in some areas such as business insurance and travel. \u201cThe National Claims Information Database report on private motor insurance showed that the average premium fell 9 per cent from quarter two, 2018 to quarter four, 2019 and CSO figures show that there has been a further 6 per cent reduction since then. \u201cFor life and pensions companies on the other hand, we would expect that overall the industry will have remained stable when compared to other years. Persistency rates generally remained static \u2013 there was low encashment and/or cancellations, for example. We also expect that group business in these sectors would be more stable than individual business. The move to remote working meant that many larger firms adapted well to the new environment and continued to operate as normal,\u201d she says. Remote working Overall, both the Central Bank and the European regulator acknowledged the insurance industry\u2019s operational resilience during the pandemic and commended the sector on its ability to move to remote working without causing material issues for consumers. Meanwhile, Covid-19 has highlighted the need and importance of insurance for a variety of sectors and industries for multiple product lines. \u201cAdmittedly it can sometimes be viewed as a grudge purchase but can prove invaluable when situations and scenarios like this happen. The pandemic has also highlighted some challenges to the industry such as policy coverage, scope and limitations of coverage which will need to be eradicated in the future. \u201cThe pandemic has shown that the insurance industry is resilient and despite the losses, insurance companies are still open for new business and are still paying claims for customers. With life hopefully slowly starting to return to normal and economies beginning to reopen, insurance companies will continue to play a pivotal role,\u201d Gallagher says.",

            "raw_text": "Sinn F\u00e9in has suggested that employers\u2019 social insurance contributions should be raised to fund the costs of reducing the pension age to 65. \u201cWe are going to have to look at PRSI, that is going to have to happen,\u201d the party\u2019s TD Louise O\u2019Reilly said on Wednesday. Previously the party has suggested increasing the employers\u2019 contribution by 4 per cent, though Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il have warned that the move would hit jobs. Sinn F\u00e9in welcomed the report of an Oireachtas committee published on Wednesday which said that the proposed increases in the pension age from 66 should be cancelled. \u201cWe believe that at the age of 65 workers should have a choice, whether to work on . . . or retire on a pension,\u201d Ms O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cThe rules and regulations that are set by people who work in offices have to take account of the people who don\u2019t work in offices.\u201d Pensions Commission Its view runs counter to the stance of the Pensions Commission which argued the pension age should rise in steps to 67 by 2031 and then to 68 by 2039. The commission\u2019s report is currently being assessed by the Government, which is scheduled to deliver an implementation plan by next month. But Government sources say that the country has to face the looming question of the affordability of the pension system, with Ministers insisting there are few easy choices to address the inevitable demographic pressures. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the Government was likely to make a decision on the State pension age by the end of March. Government sources said that no decision had yet been made though the political difficulty of the issue is clear. Both Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il reversed their previous position on increasing the pension age during the last election campaign under pressure from the Labour Party and Sinn F\u00e9in. Mr Donohoe said the decision on the State pension age was very important due to the cost implications. Longer lives \u201cThe only money the Government has is the money that the Government collects from its citizens or borrows in their name in the future,\u201d Mr Donohoe told the RT\u00c9 News at One programme. He said while it was welcome that people were living longer, at present there were 4.5 workers for every pensioner. However, by 2050, due to demographic trends, this would fall to just two workers for every State pension holder. The economic consequences of this could mean \u201cthere will be things we will not be able to do\u201d, Mr Donohoe warned. In the D\u00e1il, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said the Government had \u201can open mind\u201d when it came to decisions on the pension age. Mr Martin said there were no easy choices and any proposals must be \u201cfiscally sound\u201d. Mr Martin said the fact that people were living longer had implications for \u201cpensions, for how we sustain society with longer lives and greater access to healthcare and interventions\u201d.",

            "author": "Joe Brennan; Harry McGee",
            "date": "2020-09-09",
            "raw_text": "The Central Bank has found that dual pricing across motor and home insurance policies is more common than coverage providers have admitted, at a time when the Government has committed to removing such practices from the Irish market. The regulatory authority moved last November to start a review of dual, or differential, pricing in the insurance market, where customers with a similar risk profile are charged different premiums. The most common form is where insurers offer new customers better rates than those renewing their policies, who may end up paying a \u201cloyalty premium\u201d that penalises them for not shopping around. While the Central Bank is not expected to complete the three-stage examination for another year, it has uncovered enough issues in the first phase to write to insurance providers, directing boards to have a clear understanding of the extent to which differential pricing is practised \u2013 and its effects on customers. \"While a number of firms maintain that they do not utilise differential pricing in their pricing practices, the Central Bank observed that the majority of 11 firms being reviewed do utilise differential pricing through various techniques,\" Derville Rowland, director-general of financial conduct at the Central Bank, said in a \"dear CEO\" letter sent to insurance firms this week. \u201cFirms have a responsibility to understand fully the impact of pricing practices on their customers. Failure to recognise and/or acknowledge the practice of price differentiation raises significant concerns about a firm\u2019s ability to assess this impact.\u201d \u2018Tangible evidence\u2019 While the programme for government, agreed in June, pledged to work to \u201cremove dual pricing\u201d from the insurance market, the Central Bank\u2019s director of consumer protection, Gr\u00e1inne McEvoy, advocated on Wednesday for a \u201cmeasured and proportional approach, based on actual tangible evidence\u201d. Ms McEvoy reiterated the Central Bank\u2019s view that it is keen to avoid \u201cunintended consequences\u201d from any new regulations, such as stifling of competition. \u201cIf you ban the practice, it might result in some industry firms exiting the market, reducing competition and choice for consumers,\u201d she told The Irish Times, adding that the ability of households to secure a new customer discount by switching providers is a possible benefit of differential pricing. While the Central Bank plans to complete an interim report by the end of this year, it is not yet clear whether it will contain recommendations. A final report is expected to be published in the third quarter of next year. Se\u00e1n Fleming, Minister of State with responsibility for Financial Services, Credit Unions and Insurance, said he \"noted with concern\" the initial Central Bank findings and would bring this up with Insurance Ireland in the coming weeks. Sinn F\u00e9in finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said the finding has vindicated his claim the insurance industry was using the approach to prey on vulnerable customers. Behavioural patterns He said insurance companies were using big data \u2013 including information legitimately bought from marketing companies and online sites \u2013 to predict the behavioural patterns of existing customers, to ascertain if they would shop around at premium renewal time. He said that had led to premium levels being inflated for some customers who were more likely to stay with the companies. \u201cWe have called on the Government to ban the practice of dual pricing. That is why I have drafted legislation that is currently before the Office of Parliamentary Legal Affairs, to actually bring this practice to an end.\u201d The UK's Financial Conduct Authority said last October in an interim report on its own investigation of the issue that six million consumers in the UK were being hit with loyalty penalties, totalling \u00a31.2 billion (\u20ac1.3 billion), by not shopping around. Its final report, including recommendations, was originally due in the first quarter of this year but remains unpublished. Last year, the Central Bank of Ireland introduced a new rule requiring motor insurers to prominently include details of the previous year\u2019s premium on the renewal notices sent to customers, in order to encourage consumers to survey the market for value.",

            "raw_text": "When insurance costs go up, premiums go up. When insurance costs go down, premiums go down. No they don't. More often than not the industry finds a convenient excuse to maintain the status quo. Claims are too high, payouts are too generous, doing business in Ireland is too expensive. Like a suave salesman, the industry has a number of set-pieces. In marriage guidance parlance, we have what's described as an asymmetrical relationship with our insurance overlords. If you had any doubt about this, surely the business interruption debacle of the past year has crystallised it for you. Even though thousands of businesses paid to insure their operations against the very eventuality that ensued, they found they hadn\u2019t, or had laboured under a misapprehension \u2013 namely that a nationwide lockdown triggered by a global pandemic somehow didn\u2019t meet the criteria of business interruption. That was until the courts stepped in and made the insurers read their own small print. Another bone of contention is the paltry or non-existent rebates being handed out to motorists who have had their cars off the road for much of the last 12 months. The industry is expected to save hundreds of millions of euro in reduced claims as a result \u2013 up to \u20ac290 million for 2020 alone, according to one estimate. To date, customers have been offered a \u20ac30-\u20ac40 voucher in compensation, and only by six of the biggest eight insurers \u2013 a derisory token gesture agreed last April to cover the first eight weeks of lockdown. Two firms, Aviva and AIG, didn't even sign it up to it. The phrase \"blood from a stone\" comes to mind. And there\u2019s been nothing else since, even though we\u2019ve had an additional 22 weeks of lockdown. It is estimated the reduction in traffic volumes could cut underwriting costs for the industry by 20 per cent or more. This is on the back of a bumper 2019, which saw profits on motor coverage lines surge by 9 per cent to \u20ac142 million. And does anyone believe the overhaul of personal injury payouts backed by the country\u2019s judges last week will translate into reduced premiums for customers?

            "author": "Ciara O'Brien",
            "date": "2024-04-25",
            "raw_text": "I love noise-cancelling earbuds. They block out just the right amount of background noise to make even the most challenging work environment or commute tolerable. Sometimes I\u2019ll wear them with no podcasts or music playing, just for the world-deadening capabilities they offer. Sony has been doing good work in this area for a long time. The quality of noise cancelling technology in its products has put it ahead of some rivals in the field, although you can pay a premium for the privilege. Noise-cancelling earbuds don\u2019t just block out noise by plugging up your ear canal; they use technology to effectively neutralise certain frequencies of noise. A built-in microphone analyses the noise around you, measuring the ambient noise, and then the technology generates opposite sound waves to counter it. Sony\u2019s newest earbuds, the diminutive WF-1000XM5 wireless buds, make the most of this expertise. The buds themselves are fairly standard in design: small, glossy black buds that sit right into your ear, rather than the stem design favoured by Apple, Huawei and others. There is a small, matt, touch-enabled panel on each earbud that can be customised to various functions \u2013 more on that later \u2013 and the microphone array. They snap magnetically into the pill-shaped charging case, which will give you up to 24 hours of listening time from the buds. The buds themselves are smaller and lighter than their predecessors so they feel more secure, although that previously mentioned glossy finish can make it harder to get a grip of them at times when you want to take them out. But they are definitely less protruding than previous earbuds Sony has made, which is a bonus. The earbuds use Sony\u2019s multi-noise sensor technology that Sony says is its biggest step forward in noise cancelling technology to date. It uses three microphones on each earbud, including dual feedback mics, to help improve low-frequency cancellation and can capture ambient sound more accurately. They also have two proprietary processors that Sony says cancel more external noise than ever and, when combined with the noise isolation earbud tips, you get a good in-ear fit that won\u2019t budge with less noise leaking in. They are comfortable to wear over long periods of time, although you will want to get the fit right initially or they will feel like they are about to shake loose at times Sony has adaptive noise cancelling so it can change as you move from different environments \u2013 say from a relatively quiet office to a noisier commute along a busy road \u2013 and can be linked to your movements. For example, if the earbuds detect you are staying in one place, sitting down at your desk, say, you can turn ambient sound on to allow you to hear colleagues chatting to you. You can register different locations, too, just in case you have different preferences for sitting down at home or at your desk. To take advantage of this, you will need to sign up for the Sony headphones connect app. There are some customisation options within the app such as tapping to control music and take calls. You can also opt in to using Alexa as a voice assistant, controlled by the touch sensitive control panel on the earbud itself. This works alongside the built-in digital assistant, such as Siri or Google Assistant, that you can activate through the usual \u201cHey Siri\u201d or Hello Google\u201d commands. What about the sound quality? These earbuds don\u2019t disappoint. They support high res audio and, with Sony\u2019s new dynamic driver X, which is specially designed for wide frequency reproduction, you get better detail and vocals than ever before. Even if you aren\u2019t particularly finicky about music quality, the buds will deliver better audio across the board. With Sony\u2019s 360 reality audio, you can use the app to analyse your individual ear shape to get more immersive music, although this isn\u2019t a deal breaker for me. There are times when immersive audio isn\u2019t quite what you need, and it ends up being more annoying than immersive. The call quality on the earbuds is excellent, with the smaller profile working in their favour, particularly when you are outdoors. They are also comfortable to wear over long periods of time, although you will want to get the fit right initially or they will feel like they are about to shake loose at times. What about the sustainability credentials? The buds themselves come in sustainable packaging, with little visible plastic. The packaging itself has also been shrunk down so you don\u2019t get a giant box for the tiny earbuds and various accessories. Replacing the built-in battery would be a challenge, however. Good Sound quality here is excellent, and the changes Sony has made have led to real improvements rather than just tweaking for the sake of it. The smaller buds are easier to wear for longer, and do not feel as precarious as some of the earlier wireless earbuds. Battery life is good, with a total of 24 hours out of the buds and the case. Bad Not the cheapest out there, although you might argue that you get what you pay for. Also the glossy finish means you can struggle to grip the buds at times. Everything else The earbuds support multipoint connections, so you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch easily between the two. The connection itself is also very stable, using a new integrated processor that transmits the Bluetooth signal simultaneously to and from both ears. Add in support for the next generation of low latency Bluetooth audio, LE Audio, and you have a decent set of Bluetooth buds on your hands. Verdict Sony\u2019s expertise comes to the fore again.",

            "raw_text": "Global insurance giant Arthur J Gallagher has announced its arrival in the Irish market with the acquisition of insurance group Innovu for an undisclosed sum. The deal will see S&P 500-listed Gallagher take sole ownership of the company \u2014 with Innovu\u2019s majority shareholder, private equity firm MML Capital Partners, exiting its investment after four years along with other, smaller shareholders. During those four years, Innovu has been one of the driving forces behind a wave of consolidation in the Irish brokerage market, having snapped up five separate brokers across the State. Headquartered in Wexford and with offices in Kerry, Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere, Innovu now employs 135 people and boasts gross written premium of around \u20ac62 million. Gallagher, with a market capitalisation in excess of $33 billion, is one of the biggest insurance brokers and risk management outfits in the world. In a statement on Friday, Micheal Rea, chief executive of Gallagher\u2019s UK and Ireland retail division, said the acquisition gives the company the \u201cperfect launch pad\u201d in Ireland.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 \u201cI have been keen to establish a Gallagher presence in Ireland and the impressive speed at which the [Innovu] business has grown and proven itself over the last four years is testament to the entrepreneurial spirit and innovative approach of its leadership team,\u201d Mr Rea said. Ronan Foley, chief executive of Innovu, said the deal gives the company an \u201cideal platform\u201d to continue its \u201cambitious plans for growth through a combination of organic and acquisition-led expansion\u201d. \u201cI am delighted that we will be part of a global business that is focused on its people alongside its clients,\u201d Mr Foley said. \u201cWe aim to establish Gallagher as the go-to broker in Ireland, and being able to draw on its global expertise and specialisms means we will be able to further support more businesses and individuals with their insurance and risk management needs.\u201d Shane Cooke, investment director at MML, said the private equity company was \u201cdelighted\u201d to have worked with the Innovu team and wished them well for the future. \u201cWe see this development as a significant opportunity for both Gallagher and Innovu and places the businesses here in a strong strategic position for the future,\u201d he said. The deal follows  several years of unprecedented consolidation  within the Irish brokerage market, which continues to attract private equity investment. Innovu, backed by MML, has been among the main driving forces behind this trend, snapping up five Irish brokers \u2014 most recently Cullen Insurances and Wexford-based PE Kelly Insurances in October last year. Over the past four years, Innovu has also acquired Sheridan Insurances, Wexford Insurances, and Goggin Insurance Brokers. Irish company Arachas, bought by UK-based Ardonagh Group \u2014 itself backed by US private-equity outfits HPS Investment Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners \u2014 for about \u20ac250 million in 2020, has been the most active dealmaker in recent years. Since the takeover, Arachas has bought a number of brokers including sports and events specialist O\u2019Driscoll O\u2019Neil and Waterford-based Hooper Dolan. UK private equity company Livingbridge acquired a majority stake in Chill Insurance in 2020 in a deal that valued the Irish business at up to \u20ac100 million. Irish-based private equity outfit Melior Capital, meanwhile, bought a majority stake in Dublin-based BHP Insurance last summer.",

            "raw_text": "Engineers Ireland officials warned the Oireachtas finance committee on Wednesday that delivery of homes and other construction projects could be hit because engineers who carry out fire-safety inspections face mounting insurance costs. Vice-president of Engineers Ireland John Power said a number of UK insurance underwriters that dominated the professional indemnity market had withdrawn from the Republic, while others had hiked premiums as the industry deals with the aftermath of Brexit, Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017 and 2018 collapse of UK construction group Carillion. Committee member Mair\u00e9ad Farrell (SF) told the hearing that one fire-safety company that had contacted her saw its premium for professional indemnity coverage jump from \u20ac2,500 in 2019 to \u20ac7,000 last year. While it was initially unable to secure a quote for this year, the insurance company ultimately returned with a price of \u20ac65,000. Michael Lyons, chairman of Engineers Ireland's fire and safety unit, said many members of the organisation are saying that quotes for policy renewals have \"trebled or quadrupled\" so far this year. Moreover, underwriters are also narrowing what the policies would cover, he added. \u201cIf the current trend persists, after a year of renewal notices, there will be relatively few firms in a position to offer fire-safety certification design and of construction,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cThis will impact the approval of designs, commencement of projects or the handover of completed projects such as houses, flats, nursing homes and factories. The inevitability is that the construction sector will suffer significantly and there will be a significant number of job losses as professional level,\u201d he said. The warning comes as construction in the Republic is only beginning to ramp up following more than three months of virtual lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, industry figures say builders are facing sharp raw material price hikes amid shortages of timber, steel, insulation and other supplies. This is being fuelled by global demand spikes and coronavirus-related bottlenecks, as well as issues relating to Brexit. Motor insurance Separately, Axa Insurance Ireland chief executive Philip Bradley told the committee that the largest provider of motor insurer in the Republic, with a 30 per cent market share, reduced motor premiums by \u20ac80, or 12 per cent, on average for customers renewing coverage in April. This was on foot of new Judicial Council guidelines, paving the way for personal injury award reductions coming into effect at the end of last month. The general manager of US insurer AIG's Irish business, Aidan Connaughton, said his company had \"already begun to implement rate changes as a result of the anticipated benefits\" via the guidelines. Senior executives from insurers Aviva Insurance Ireland, FBD and Zurich Insurance appeared before the same committee last week.",

Specifically, we do not have universal healthcare, and operate a two-tier system that is unfair and highly unusual. Your front-page story on Thursday (\u201cHikes in health insurance loom in months ahead\u201d, News, May 25th) outlines how health insurance premiums are likely to continue to rise. For the 50 per cent or so of Irish people with private cover, this raises distressing choices. In other words, half of Irish people are paying for the same thing twice: through tax, which funds the public system, and through expensive insurance premiums, which funds our overlapping private system. This is inefficient and ultimately unnecessary. Those who do not have private cover, meanwhile, face longer waits for many vital forms of care, from children\u2019s disability assessments to prostate surgery. This is deeply wrong, and also unnecessary. In addition to tax and insurance costs, we bear the third burden of out-of-pocket charges, to a greater extent than elsewhere. For example, most citizens pay out of pocket, in full, to see a GP; this occurs nowhere else in Europe. Also, if you have private insurance, you still have to pay for many elements of your care, from seeing a consultant to buying medications. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Universal healthcare systems guarantee high-quality and timely care to all who need it, based on clinical need and not on ability to pay. It is based on a conception of healthcare as a human right of all people. It is not a radical idea: every other country in western Europe has universal healthcare, not to mention most of the countries to which our healthcare workers are emigrating, like New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Everybody pays in, and everybody gets a fair deal. Countries achieve universal healthcare by one of two main routes: tax or insurance. The universal insurance route \u2013 like Germany\u2019s \u2013 was floated under Dr James Reilly. It was shelved for several reasons, particularly the concern that it would inflate costs without necessarily improving care. The other main route is through tax \u2013 as in Scandinavia, Canada, and of course the NHS. I think this is the best fit for Ireland. Sl\u00e1intecare is based on this model. We must invest in our public system so that it meets the needs of our people, who will not feel the need to recourse to additional private cover. It requires major investment, political leadership, and buy-in from healthcare workers. Rather than pouring money endlessly into a leaky bucket, we need to have the maturity as a society to look around us and to realise that there is a better way. As it stands, Sl\u00e1intecare is that way forward. It can deliver a fairer system and a better deal for all of us. Let\u2019s do it. \u2013 Yours, etc, Dr DOMHNALL McGLACKEN-BYRNE, Bray, Co Wicklow.",

            "raw_text": "South African insurance group Outsurance has initiated a soft launch of Irish motor and home coverage offering ahead of the local unit\u2019s planned official opening for business next month. Outsurance Ireland, chaired by Tony Keohane, who is also chairman of the Football Association of Ireland and Uisce \u00c9ireann, currently has 72 staff at its offices in Cherrywood, in south Dublin, and aims to build it in the coming years to almost 300 employees. The Irish company\u2019s chief executive Peter Broome said the recent launch of its website and \u201csoft launch\u201d phase is helping it refine its systems and pricing. \u201cWe have been quoting customers and have welcomed our first Outsurance Ireland policy holders who saved money on their insurance,\u201d he said. The insurer is currently distributing car and home insurance directly to consumers online and through its call centre, he said. However, it is expected that the company will also use the broker channel in time. The new insurer, which was granted final authorisation by the  Central Bank of Ireland  in December, has received \u20ac100 million of capital from its parent to meet regulatory requirements and finance itself as it seeks to grow in the coming years. Outsurance is among a number of companies that have moved recently to get into the Irish market following a series of reforms aimed at reducing volatility and coverage costs in a historically highly-volatile market even by the standards of the cyclical nature of insurance internationally. Italian insurance giant  Generali  entered the market in January through the completion of the purchase of Liberty Mutual\u2019s businesses in Ireland, Spain and Portugal in a deal worth \u20ac2.3 billion. This marked a return by the Italian group to the Irish general insurance market some 22 years after it closed its Dublin office, which had been writing small amounts of property and casualty business as well as commercial insurance at the time. Revolut , meanwhile, also entered the Irish motor insurance market, with policies underwritten by AIG. [\u00a0 Will Revolut\u2019s vow to undercut Irish car insurers by 30% reactivate the industry\u2019s herd instincts? \u00a0] The introduction of judicial guidelines on personal injury awards in 2021 has led to a sharp fall in the average award by the Injuries Resolution Board (IRB), formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Other Government initiatives include the enactment of laws last year to strengthen IRB\u2019s role, with the introduction of a mediation service, as well as legislation aimed at balancing a property owner or business\u2019s responsibilities with those of customers or the general public. The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that the judicial guidelines have legal effect, in a landmark judgment after a test case had challenged their validity. Government Ministers and business lobby groups have put fresh pressure on insurers, following the ruling, to cut premiums. [\u00a0 Finding that guidelines slashing personal injury awards has legal effect \u2018of systemic importance\u2019 - Supreme Court \u00a0] The average motor premiums fell 22 per cent between their peak in late 2017 and the end of 2022, according to Central Bank data, helped by an industry-wide decline in claims costs after the guidelines were introduced. However, latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show that motor rates have increased by 4.2 per cent in the 12 months through February. The increase has largely been down to a spike in motor damage costs, amid inflation for labour and car parts, according to insurance sources.

The latest House Rebuilding Guide, published by the SCSI, shows that national average rebuild costs, which include demolition and site clearance, have increased by an average of 12 per cent over the past 12 months. HealthBeacon\u2019s former chief executive, Jim Joyce, who was   ousted from his role  last month after the medtech issued a sales warning, is among parties that have expressed an interest in taking part in a rescue investment in the company as it faces running out of cash, according to sources. Joe Brennam reports. Stabilising interest rates could boost   mergers and acquisitions  (M&A), corporate financiers say as new figures show Irish deal making rising despite falling numbers of transactions globally. Irish mergers and acquisitions reached 116 in the three months ended September 30th, up 5.5 per cent on the same period last year, according to the Davy Corporate Finance Quarter 3 M&A review. Barry O\u2019Halloran has the details. Joe also tells us in Agenda that   HealthBeacon  is fighting for its very survival. With only enough cash to keep going for days, the board, which founder Jim Joyce left last Friday after stepping down as a non-executive director, is desperately trying to secure fresh investment or a sale of the business as its advisers also work on a backup \u2013 or parallel \u2013 option of filing for examinership. Almost exactly a decade ago Ireland\u2019s pint-supping public was preparing for its biggest shock to the system since the smoking ban as   British pub group JD Wetherspoon  announced its entry to the market with its first acquisition here.

And when you need help, get it back,\u201d   Cork\u2019s Ann Kelleher  tells Ciara O\u2019Brien in our Interview of the Week. She is sharing the philosophy that has helped propel her to the senior ranks in global chip powerhouse Intel. Heading up the technology development division of the business, the Irishwoman has been credited with the turnaround of the unit by Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger, where she was responsible for the research, development and deployment of next-generation silicon logic, packaging and test technologies. In recent decades we have developed  a plethora of regulatory bodie  s , covering a wide range of economic and social activity, including  the Commission for Regulation of Utilities , ComReg , and the Irish Aviation Authority . While all of these bodies deal with different sectors, they also have major commonalities: how to regulate monopolies or dominant firms. Their number and diversity of practice does not make sense, argues John FitzGerald in his weekly column. So, you think you\u2019ve got influencing nailed. Your powers of persuasion have worked well in the past and there is no reason to think they won\u2019t do so again. Not so fast. The number one thing that prevents people becoming better influencers is the assumption that they\u2019re good at it.   Olive Keogh  reports.

            "raw_text": "An action against an insurance broker over business interruption cover has been settled in the Commercial Court. The operators of Dublin's Clarence Hotel, Brushfield Ltd \u2013 which is part of the Press Up Entertainment Group \u2013 had sued Arachas Corporate Brokers Ltd which arranged the hotel's insurance policy with Axa. Last April, Mr Justice Denis McDonald dismissed the case against Axa. He rejected claims by Brushfield that it was entitled to be compensated for losses due to the lockdowns under its \u201centerprise\u201d insurance policy with Axa. The judge said he had not been persuaded that cover was available under the specific terms of the Axa policy for losses resulting from the closure of the hotel and its Octagon bar in the wake of Government advice on Covid in March 2020. The case against Arachas had yet to be heard. On Thursday, Paul McGarry SC, for Brushfield, said the proceedings had been compromised against Arachas and he was seeking an order striking out the case and vacating previous costs and directions orders. Mr McGarry said all allegations of wrongdoing and professional negligence against Arachas were being withdrawn. The settlement did not involve any payment being made by either party, he said. Mr Justice McDonald welcomed the settlement and made an order striking out all proceedings. Proud In a statement afterwards, Arachas chief executive Conor Brennan said his company was proud of its business and reputation. This was underlined by the successful outcome of the case which had been a \u201cvery challenging and stressful time, not just for us but for Irish brokers around this country, all of us trying to deal with an unprecedented and rapidly changing crisis\u201d. He said Arachas had \u201cworked incredibly hard supporting Irish businesses through the pandemic\u201d. It would continue to work closely with Government, insurers, business representative groups and, most importantly, with its clients to secure the best possible outcome even in very challenging circumstances, he said.",

An estimated 128,100 people were employed in those sectors in July, a small decline of about 100 since June, but up 6.9 per cent from 120,200 people in July 2022, according to the seasonally adjusted payroll estimates. A CSO spokesman said financial services companies, insurers and property-related companies had been steadily increasing hiring since the middle of 2021. A Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland and Federation of International Banks in Ireland report published earlier this year indicated that Ireland is now the sixth biggest exporter of financial services globally. More than 14,200 people were employed by international banks in Ireland, an increase of more than 16 per cent compared with 2019. Meanwhile, the food services and accommodation sector suffered the worst monthly decline in July from the previous month with the number of people employed falling 3.7 per cent. It is understood that the drop-off, coming as it did in the middle of the busy summer tourism season, may have been lower and is subject to change when the estimates are revised. The decline could also relate model used to adjust the figures for seasonal effects, which may have to be revised due to the severe impact of the pandemic on tourism-adjacent businesses. However, there is some indication that the food and hotel sectors contracted in the month due to poor trading conditions in what Met \u00c9ireann has described, provisionally, as the wettest July on record.

            "raw_text": "If only I knew then what I know now. On St Brigid\u2019s Day 2023, I spent 24 hours in the Emergency Department of  Wexford General Hospital  with an elderly relative who has  dementia  and suffered a significant medical event at home about 7pm on Sunday. The ambulance came quickly, and the paramedics were excellent. All went well until we got to the hospital. That ambulance and its crew sat outside for about an hour, before we got in the door of the ED. We were lucky, up to a point. We got a trolley in a cubicle, which was a penthouse suite compared to sitting on a chair in harsh lighting on the open floor of an emergency room. The short version of the story is that the patient first saw a doctor about 8am on Monday and was finally in a bed by teatime. Comfortable now in a ward, what happened next was worse. That acute hospital bed was occupied for three nights while only very few tests were performed sporadically over several days. Bad possibilities eventually ruled out, it was time to go home \u2013 reassured, but none the wiser. In an efficient system, the patient should not have been in that bed for more than one night, if at all. The knock-on misery of others still waiting was entirely avoidable. That vigil of St Brigid\u2019s Day I repeatedly asked who was available from management and was told that no one was. The irony is the health system across the board is increasingly doing more and better. The bad examples are highlighted by good work elsewhere. The culture I encountered that night in Wexford was of a place that didn\u2019t welcome questions. It is a place that needs more investment. The question is whether that money would be spent effectively. Health funding increased from \u20ac13.7 billion in 2014 to \u20ac22.8 billion in 2024. Over 50,000 healthcare staff have joined the public service Knowledge is power.  What I now know is that Wexford ranks only after Limerick as the acute hospital with the greatest increase in expenditure, 2016-2022. After inflation,  real expenditure  there increased by 68 per cent over the period, only behind Limerick on 75 per cent. That and much more is available in  a first report of its kind  published last week on trends in Activity, Expenditure and Workforce in acute hospitals by the  Department of Health  and the  HSE . It should be on every news desk in the country, the better to interrogate unfiltered pleadings for ever more resources. [\u00a0 Billions in extra health funding not leading to higher activity in hospitals, report finds \u00a0] Health funding increased from \u20ac13.7 billion in 2014 to \u20ac22.8 billion in 2024. Over 50,000 healthcare staff have joined the public service. In the period of the 2016-2022 study, which is a baseline for the future, there was a 3.8 per cent increase in overall activity, compared to an inflation adjusted rise in expenditure of 45 per cent and a 29 per cent increase in staffing numbers. We are not getting bang for our buck. [\u00a0 Hospitals are getting more money but why is this not resulting in more activity? \u00a0] There is no systemic failure. Considerable waste and pressing need for further investment are simultaneous realities. What happens outside the hospital is as important as what goes on inside it. The development of community healthcare, and step-down facilities are obvious examples. On e-health, Ireland is in the stone age. And yes, we need more acute hospital beds. What has now changed is how hospitals are funded. Previously there was a tried and trusted formula which ensured that the worse things were, the more money you got. It was shroud-waving as fundraising, and it worked. In an audacious move, the health minister Stephen Donnelly enforced with brutality the obligation on all hospitals to co-operate with the Health Performance Visualisation Platform (HPVP), which is similar to a Pulse system for hospitals. They had to hand over their data or lose further capital investment. Imagine the prospect of having to turn up in a studio with talking points about what you have delivered on, relative to the budget you have, as the essential premise to asking for more. Granular detail is the antidote for codswallop The real test of his mettle will be to carry through on a threat to reward virtue in next year\u2019s funding. That would upset the modus operandi of Irish hospitals perfected over a generation. Imagine the prospect of having to turn up in a studio with talking points about what you have delivered on, relative to the budget you have, as the essential premise to asking for more. Granular detail is the antidote for codswallop. This report is an imperfect beginning. It encompasses Covid, and there is more work to do. That will deliver data by wholetime equivalent and by speciality as well as by hospital. It is the first real attempt at achieving accountability for enormous amounts of money, the management of which is essential for the quality of life of every patient and in some cases, for life itself. It would be progress if hospitals had to demonstrate delivery to secure funding increases, and many have progress to report. It is a sign of the cynicism of the system, however, that a health budget for 2024 that is a work of fiction will imminently require yet another bailout. This is a country that \u2013 windfall taxes aside \u2013 is running an underlying budget deficit. In the first quarter of this year current spending increased by an astonishing 12.9 per cent. It is La La land. It remains to be seen if knowledge empowers the public interest, not the providers of public services.",

The man, who is aged in his 50s and runs a medical practice in north Dublin, was arrested as part of a Garda investigation into some 200 fake insurance claims which were lodged with the help of a solicitors\u2019 firm. The firm, which has a presence in both Ireland and the UK, is suspected of working with medical doctors in Ireland to fabricate or embellish medical certificates detailing soft tissue injuries which never occurred. These were then used to fraudulently claim money from insurance companies. In at least some cases, the claimants did not exist. In other cases the details listed in the claim were entirely false. The doctor had allegedly helped to fabricate fraudulent medical certificates for at least a year and possibly much longer. The investigation, which is being carried out by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), is part of Operation Fraction, which is targeting a network of legal, medical and other professionals believed to be involved in false insurance claims. The operation was established following complaints to garda\u00ed from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) which noticed some of the claims contained incorrect or suspicious details. More arrests, including of medical professionals, are expected in the near future, sources said. \u201cIt is alleged that approximately 200 insurance claims were made using false identities, false utility bills supported by false medical certificates,\u201d according to a Garda spokesman. It is understood some of these claims have already been paid out while others are currently before the courts. The doctor was arrested by GNECB detectives on Friday morning \u201cas part of an ongoing investigation into alleged fraudulent insurance claims,\u201d a spokesman said. He was arrested on suspicion of two categories of offence under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001; deception, which carries a maximum five year sentence and using a false instrument, which carries up to ten years in prison. The suspect is being held for questioning in a north Dublin Garda station where he can be detained for up to 24 hours. \u201cInvestigations are ongoing,\u201d a spokesman said.",

            "author": "Joe Brennan",
            "date": "2021-10-19",
            "raw_text": "Bank of Ireland has opened up a new front to ease the burden of expensive capital tied up against its mortgage book, by effectively taking out insurance against \u20ac1.4 billion of higher-risk owner-occupier and buy-to-let loans. The bank said that a group of unnamed institutional investors and insurance companies had taken on the credit risk for \u20ac265 million of potential losses on the portfolio for an initial cost of \u20ac12 million a year, reducing over the lifetime of the transaction. The so-called credit risk transfer deal has a lifetime of as long as 15 years, but can be cancelled after 9\u00bd years, according to a spokesman. The deal has the effect of reducing the average risk weight of its Irish mortgages to 22 per cent of all home loans from 26 per cent at the end of June. The risk-weighting of a loan portfolio is a key determinant to how much expensive, rainy day capital a bank needs to hold against loans, in the event of a spike in loan defaults. Irish banks must hold much higher levels of capital against mortgages than the average European lender, a legacy of the losses sustained by lenders following the property crash. This is part of the reason why average new Irish mortgage rates \u2013 at 2.74 per cent as of August, according to the Central Bank \u2013 are more than double the European average. \u201cThere is no customer impact from the transaction. No assets will be derecognised from the group balance sheet and the reference portfolio of loan assets and related customer relationships will continue to be managed by the group,\u201d the bank said of the credit risk transfer deal. Portfolio The loans in the portfolio were included as they attract higher risk-weights because the majority of the portfolio was either restructured previously, after running into trouble, or are buy-to-let mortgage products, according to the spokesman. The bank has carried out three credit-risk transfer deals since 2016, covering Irish business loans, project finance loans and UK corporate and leverage acquisition finance exposures. However, this is the first time it has carried out such a deal involving home loans. The bank said that the latest deal would boost its key common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio by 0.3 percentage points. The bank had a 14.1 per cent CET1 ratio at the end of June, comfortably ahead of regulatory requirements. It had a medium-term goal of having a ratio of at least 13 per cent before the Covid-19 pandemic and is expected to outline a fresh target when it issues a strategy update early next year. The transaction involved two elements. Firstly the bank set up a special purpose vehicle, called Glen Securities Finance DAC, which issued notes to institutional investors accepting some of the risks in the portfolio. Unnamed insurance and reinsurance firms took up the rest of the agreed exposure. A report written by credit ratings firm Kroll Bond Rating Agency on the deal said the portfolio involved 14,657 loans, almost two-thirds of which were owner-occupier mortgages, with the rest secured against buy-to-let properties. Some 76 per cent of the loans have been restructured in the past, most of these occurring more than five years ago.",

            "raw_text": "Kieran O\u2019Leary made contact and raised an interesting point about travel insurance in the time of coronavirus. In a travel-related online Q&A we wrote last week, we pointed out that anyone who took out travel insurance after the middle of March is almost certainly not going to be covered for any coronavirus-related cancellations as all the insurance companies moved very quickly to exclude that from their cover. Many companies will already have had a clause \u2013 buried deep in the terms and conditions \u2013 stating that they do not cover pandemics. In that Q&A we pointed out that it was worth checking your travel insurance if you have had it since before the crisis began. That prompted Kieran to contact his travel insurer. \u201cI had already scrutinised the policy documents so I knew that Covid/pandemics were not excluded by my policy, but what I heard on the phone was somewhat surprising and it may be worth letting others know about,\u201d he says. \"I've had an annual travel insurance policy with AIG for the past few years. We booked this year's holiday in early January before Covid was on the horizon for most of us. As the concerns around Covid increased I was reassured that I was lucky to have a policy that did not exclude pandemics so was feeling very confident that if things went against us I would get my money back through my insurance and would not need to worry about the uncertainty of credit notes,\" he says. But his policy expires in June and his holiday is in August and when he rang his insurer he was told that he only has cover until the date my policy expires. \u201cIf I renew, my policy will have a clause to exclude cancellations due to Covid and I would not be entitled to make a claim on the basis I am not covered for cancellations caused due to Covid.\u201d He says his option now is to continue making payments for the holiday \u2013 two ferry companies and two campsites in France \"and see how things pan out between now and August. In which case if we can't travel, then take credit notes/refunds as offered by ferries and campsites. Or cancel the holiday before my current policy expires, but AIG cannot guarantee they will pay out as they evaluate each claim on a case-by-case basis.\" He says he was surprised to be caught out like this and even more surprised that there was nothing he could have done to avoid the situation he is in. \u201cI asked that should I, in hindsight, have taken out a new policy on the day I booked my holiday, but they said that would not have given me a new policy as I already had a current one. It feels highly unfair, and I wonder whether others have the same false sense of security that I had a few hours ago!\u201d Ryanair vouchers Meanwhile, a reader by the name of Ray got in touch about Ryanair and refunds. He and his wife were due to fly to Spain at the end of March with the airline. The flight was cancelled and the couple were promised a refund by email. \"Then two weeks later we were asked for patience as the airline said the demand on their service was huge, he says. About a week or two later he got another email and was offered a voucher. You have probably heard a version of this story before. You may even have told us a version of this story. \"Now, I'm not unreasonable and travel frequently with Ryanair and others and would indeed take a voucher,\" Ray says. \"But I was told that the voucher would only last for one year and not five as is the current legal situation in Ireland for vouchers. \u201cAs a result, I will not take the voucher as the Covid thing might still be with us. However, if the voucher was to last for five years I would accept it. The advantage for Ryanair is that the cost of the pandemic would be spread over a much longer period and the airlines would not be under the same pressure for cash refunds.\u201d Ray is making a good point when it comes to extending the period in which vouchers can be redeemed to five years. He was not alone in wondering what Ryanair could impose a 12-month expiry limit which seems to run contrary to the law. It doesn\u2019t. We got on to the Department of Enterprise about this and were told that a clause in the law says vouchers that are not \u201csupplied, marketed, provided or otherwise made available to be given as a gift\u201d are excluded from the new rules.",

            "date": "2020-06-17",
            "raw_text": "UK private equity firm Livingbridge has agreed to buy a majority stake in Chill Insurance, marking a second Irish deal by the London-based firm in a week. The acquisition, signed on Tuesday, will see current owners, brothers P\u00e1draig and S\u00e9amus Lynch, retain a stake of about 30 per cent, according to sources. While they declined to discuss financial details, industry sources had put a value of as much as \u20ac100 million on the business earlier this year when speculation was rife that it was on the block. Livingbridge said in a statement on Wednesday that the transaction builds on its extensive experience in the insurance sector. This includes its current investment in UK insurance broker Jensten Group and previous holding in Kingsbridge Risk Solutions, a specialist broker. Chill Insurance had denied that it was up for sale when contacted by The Irish Times in February, saying that US investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW), which had been hired to advise the company, was looking at debt financing options to help fund growth plans. P\u00e1draig Lynch said at the time that an equity raise was not on the cards. Sources said that KBW subsequently received bid interest in Chill Insurance, and that this route proved more compelling as the Covid-19 pandemic began to play out across the economy and financial markets. The Sunday Times reported last month that Livingbridge was circling Chill Insurance. It is understood that Chill Insurance is in talks on two potential deals, with one said to be at an advanced stage. Chill Insurance was founded in 2006 by the Lynches, and has subsequently grown into the largest independent personal lines insurance broker in Ireland with over 200,000 policyholders, representing a 6 per cent market share. It is led by chief executive Michael McLaughlin and employs almost 250 staff. Growth journey \u201cWe are excited by the prospect of partnering with Livingbridge on the next stage in our growth journey,\u201d said Mr McLaughlin. \u201cWe have been impressed by their successful track record in scaling insurance businesses, and their expertise will be invaluable as we continue to widen our reach in the personal lines sector, expand our portfolio of complementary financial services products and build our M&A [mergers and acquisitions] capability.\u201d Consolidation in the consumer-focused area of insurance broking is behind that in corporate broking. Arachas, an acquisitive corporate broker in recent years, changed hands itself in recent months, with US private equity firms HPS Investment Partners and Madison Dearborn acquiring a controlling interest in a deal that valued the business at a reported \u20ac250 million. Arachas closed a deal in recent weeks to buy Dublin-based broker O\u2019Driscoll O\u2019Neill. Last week, Livingstone bought a majority stake in Galway-based cyber security company TitanHQ, which protects more than 8,500 businesses, including Virgin, O2 and Pepsi.",

            "date": "2021-02-23",
            "raw_text": "Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) has said it is examining insurance cover options on the movement of cash from racecourses after suffering a \u20ac389,000 loss through the liquidation of a security transit company. In 2019 a liquidator was appointed in the case of Business Mobile Security Services, the holding company of Senaca. HRI employed Senaca since 2017 to transport Tote takings from all tracks in the country as well as gate receipts and cash takings from its own racecourses. Racing\u2019s ruling body had its 2019 financial statements examined by the D\u00e1il\u2019s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday where it was outlined how Seneca\u2019s shortfall to all of its clients was \u20ac2.1 million with \u20ac389,000 of that applying to HRI and its subsidiaries. They include Tote Ireland which lost \u20ac281,000. Appearing by video link before the committee, HRI's chief executive Brian Kavanagh described it as a \"very unfortunate event from our point of view\" but added there was no loss from the State's funding of racing in 2019. Paul McAuliffe TD asked both Kavanagh and HRI's chief financial officer Suzanne Eade about future insurance provisions that might be considered in the event of potential fraud. \u201cWe have a policy for racecourses which normally covers fraud. That is normally fraud on the part of an employee rather than on the part of a third party. The Tote did not have that insurance,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cApparently that is not something insurance companies offer in relation to gambling companies. \u201cWe have built up controls and we are looking to see if insurance can be provided against this type of activity.\u201d Eade said HRI was among those owed money who had argued that cash shouldn\u2019t be regarded as part of a company\u2019s assets. She said insurance provisions had not changed since then. \u201cWe have a crime policy and the issue with the crime policy is that one, we can\u2019t seem to get it for gambling takings no matter where we go to look for that, and the second one is that when somebody has potentially perpetuated a crime against you, but you have a contractual relationship with them, that\u2019s where the argument is falling down with us,\u201d she said. Eade commented that the new cash in transit provider was \u201cbang on\u201d in terms of HRI\u2019s requirements but said the body would examine if better insurance opportunities can become available. Kavanagh came under sustained criticism from some TD\u2019s about the lack of CCTV pictures in stable yards in Ireland on the back of the high-profile Viking Hoard case where the Charles Byrnes-trained horse was \u2018nobbled\u2019 with a sedative at Tramore in 2018. HRI allocated money for the installation of CCTV at some racecourse stable yards in 2018 but that was subsequently diverted by the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB) to licensing matters with the approval of racing\u2019s governing body. That decision has proved embarrassing for racing with the lack of CCTV at Tramore when Viking Hoard was doped serving to highlight how cameras for integrity purposes only are still located in just one racecourse stable yard in Ireland. The PAC chairman Brian Stanley asked Kavanagh if he agreed with him that one yard among the country's 25 tracks is a very poor outcome and the HRI boss did so. However, he also pointed out that the IHRB are responsible for integrity and that a tender for the installation of stable yard CCTV at all racecourses will be issued by the regulator in the coming weeks. The semi-State body\u2019s 2019 financial statement also showed a \u20ac2.1 million loss for that year in relation to its share in the Curragh racecourse. Kavanagh told the committee that Irish racing\u2019s HQ was profitable in 2020. Responding to questions from TD's Verona Murphy and Se\u00e1n Sherlock about a possible resumption of point-to-point racing which was suspended last month, Kavanagh said he hoped the sector can return to action as quickly as possible, although couldn't give any date. He said it is important to stage point-to-points on their usual sites as any switch to running them on racecourses would only facilitate \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d when it comes to demand. \u201cThe solution is resumption,\u201d Kavanagh said.",

            "raw_text": "Taoiseach Simon Harris  will today issue a State apology to the families of the  Stardust fire tragedy , more than 40 years after the blaze that ripped through the nightclub in north Dublin. Speaking on the way into Government Buildings on Tuesday morning, Mr Harris said: \u201cI think these are families that have been failed for over four decades, they\u2019re families who have looked for answers for over four decades, they\u2019re families who all often have had these gates here shut to them and governments not listening to them.\u201d Mr Harris will update the Cabinet this morning about the planned apology after an inquest jury last week returned a verdict that all victims were unlawfully killed. It comes after a previous finding in 1982 that the fire the previous year had been started deliberately. \u201cI have had really important, heartfelt and emotional engagement with many of the families over the last few days. I was very pleased to visit the Stardust Memorial in Artane last night, and I wanted to be there and to be at the spot of where this fire happened, in advance of delivering the apology today,\u201d the Taoiseach said. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll let the apology speak for itself later in the D\u00e1il. And but I do really hope it\u2019s an apology that can help aid the healing process.\u201d The relatives of the 48 young people who died in the fire have long called for an official State apology. The Government will accept last week\u2019s verdict and the recommendations of the inquest jury. Mr Harris will ask Minister for Justice Helen McEntee and other relevant Ministers to report back on their implementation. Two Government sources said the issue of redress has not yet been explored fully, with the Government keen to keep the focus on the State apology today. Why did justice for Stardust victims take so long? The Department of Taoiseach will be tasked with preparing proposals to commemorate the disaster following a consultation with the families. Stardust relatives and survivors met Mr Harris over the weekend, where he \u201capologised unreservedly to each family\u201d. Mr Harris described meeting the 70 people who had a connection to the tragedy as \u201chumbling and emotional\u201d. The families have been invited to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann today and will be sitting in the visitor\u2019s gallery for the State apology. Normal D\u00e1il business \u2014 such as Leaders\u2019 Questions \u2014 will be postponed for the apology. Last week a 12-person jury found, for the first time, that the fire that resulted in the deaths of the 48 people, aged 16 to 27, started in a hot-press and was caused by an electrical fault. The jury found that at the time of the fire, exits in the Stardust Ballroom were either locked, chained, or otherwise obstructed. For this reason, those who died were impeded in their ability to access or exit through the emergency exits. More than 90 days of evidence and testimony from 373 witnesses were heard at the inquiry.

            "author": "Edel Corrigan",
            "date": "2023-05-04",
            "raw_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and its seemingly endless applications to every sector, industry, and technology have been in the news again of late with the release of Chat GPT. While innovations such as these cause a splash \u2013 and sometimes a little fear \u2013 the use of AI in industry has been around for some time. In the insurance industry, AI is used to assess risks and claims \u2013 but has AI inherited bias from its human creators, and is it ethical to use it? AI and Insurance The insurance industry has a deep heritage in data analytics where data has always been collected and processed to inform underwriting decisions, price policies, settle claims and prevent fraud, says Jean Rea, partner, applied intelligence, KPMG. \u201cIt is therefore not surprising that there are many opportunities arising for the use of big data and analytics including AI in insurance. \u201cThere are a broad range of uses of big data and AI across the insurance value chain \u2013 for example, they can be used to improve product offerings for consumers, develop more targeted and personalised marketing campaigns, improve customer experience through automating and digitalising the customer journey, and so on.\u201d There are many benefits to both consumers and insurers in the greater use of big data and AI insurance, including a greater ability to understand and model risks, thereby enhancing firms\u2019 abilities to understand and assess risks, development of new or enhanced products, automation, and reducing the cost of serving customers, says Rea. \u201cBig data and AI will enable insurers to further enhance risk assessment capabilities, and therefore consumers that were previously perceived as higher risk such as younger drivers may have greater access to more affordable insurance. With AI, once you do bring it in, it opens the door to reducing discrimination that may have been there undetected for many years \u2014 Prof Cal B Muckley, UCD \u201cAI can help facilitate the development of more novel insurance products such as usage-based insurance products, for example, the use of vehicle telematic devices for pay-how-you-drive or pay-as-you-drive products. Such products are more tailored to consumers\u2019 needs.\u201d Robotic process automation and optical character recognition can be used to improve insurance processes such as underwriting and claims processes, therefore improving customer experience and reducing costs. \u201cSimilarly, the use of natural language processing, voice recognition and chatbots can facilitate better communication and access to insurance services. In addition, claims processes can be improved. For example, image recognition can be used to automate and speed up the processing of damage-related claims, and drones can be used for remote claims inspections. This will allow claims to be paid faster and cost less to settle, which should in turn reduce premiums.\u201d The downsides Rea says that some of the other challenges with AI in insurance relate to the complexity and potential lack of transparency or explainability of AI algorithms, in particular, where the use-cases involved could have a material impact on consumer outcomes or firms themselves. In such cases, heightened governance and oversight of algorithms can be helpful to mitigate these challenges. \u201cSimilar to other approaches reliant on data to build and parameterise models, biases can be inherent in AI. \u201cThere are many forms of bias, and it can be introduced throughout the model development cycle. For example, the data on which models are built and trained may not be representative of the intended purpose of the model and hence [are] biased, the variables used in the model or complex combinations of them inherent in the model could be closely linked to discriminating factors (known as proxy bias), and biases of the model developers could get reflected in the model design and build.\u201d Inherited and inherent bias Professor Prof Cal B Muckley, PhD, chair in operational risk, banking & finance, University College Dublin (UCD), agrees there is potential for the AI and machine learning algorithms to have bias, whether inherent (proxy) or inherited. Inherited bias is when, for example, the algorithm is looking at mortgage decisions data over recent decades, says Prof Muckley. \u201cIt may be that the loan officers making those decisions were biased against a certain demographic, and their decisions could reflect a higher rate of loan decline than would have been there then if this discrimination hadn\u2019t been there. You\u2019re training an AI model on all of these decisions, and the machine-learning algorithm is built to pick up patterns. It may very well pick that bias up and make it harder for that demographic, or even worse it will exacerbate and extrapolate the data.\u201d We\u2019ll probably never be able to eliminate prejudicial estimates, whether by people or AI or any combination of the two, says Prof Muckley. \u201cWith AI, once you do bring it in, it opens the door to reducing discrimination that may have been there undetected for many years.\u201d",

            "title": "Motor insurance premiums fall 5%, Central Bank figures suggest",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2023-04-25",
            "raw_text": "The price of motor insurance has continued to fall with premiums costing 5 per cent less in the first half of 2022 compared with 2021 prices, according to a new report from the Central Bank of Ireland. At \u20ac578, the average cost of a motor insurance policy is \u20ac135 less than it was in 2017, the report states. The figures, contained in the first midyear report from the National Claims Information Database, have been welcomed by the Government and the insurance industry, although concern has been expressed at the volume of motor insurance cases continuing to go through the courts. The total settled claims in the first six months of 2022 totalled about 67,000, with 6 per cent covering injury claims and 94 per cent representing claims for damages. The cost of settled claims was \u20ac278 million with 55 per cent relating to injury claim costs and 45 per cent to damages. The report points to an increase in the number and cost of damages claims, and a decrease in the number and cost of injury claims. Some 48 per cent of claimants settled directly, making up 15 per cent of total costs, with 13 per cent settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), a figure which represents 6 per cent of the total costs. The PIAB was set up in 2004 to provide an alternative to the courts for settling compensation disputes without expensive litigation, the objective being to reduce insurance costs. While the numbers using the system are substantial, the court route is still taken by significant numbers. According to the data, 39 per cent of claims were settled through litigation, with this cohort making up 79 per cent of the total costs in the first half of last year. A new compensation system was introduced by the Government in early 2021 to contain spiralling costs. Under the new rules, the same award guidelines are used to determine both PIAB and court claims. According to the report, 43 per cent of injury claims were settled under the new guidelines in the first half of last year with the remainder settled with reference to the Book of Quantum, which outlines a list of specific types of injury and an indication of the level of compensation that is likely to be awarded in respect of that particular injury. The report also indicates that the share of motorists with comprehensive cover has increased to 90 per cent, up from about 80 per cent in 2018. Insurance Ireland said the figures \u201cdemonstrate and reaffirm that insurers have followed through on their commitment to pass on the benefits of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines to consumers\u201d. The chief executive of the group, Moyagh Murdock, said the report showed \u201ca notable increase in the number and cost of damage claims due to various inflationary pressures among other issues\u201d. She expressed concern that only 13 per cent of claimants settled through PIAB and noted that claimants \u201creceive roughly the same level of award\u201d whether opting for litigation or PIAB. This trend is negating some of the benefits implemented as part of the Government\u2019s Action Plan for Insurance Reform. Ms Murdock said it was \u201cwell publicised that the cost of legal fees feeds into the cost of insurance significantly, so this issue needs to be prioritised in order to swing the pendulum back in favour of consumers and the wider economy\u201d. The Minister for State for Financial Services, Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, said the fall in premium prices was proof the \u201cactions of Government in tackling the cost of insurance continues to benefit consumers\u201d.",

            "raw_text": "To listen to some of the discussion about the insurance sector this week, you would be forgiven for thinking that a) insurers are not passing on the benefits of sector reform to customers and b) it is wrong that insurers make a profit. Neither of these suppositions is correct. Insurers have most definitely been passing on benefits of reform to consumers. In the motor insurance market, premiums have been coming down consistently since 2016. According to the National Claims Information Database (NCID) report issued by the Central Bank on Tuesday, motor insurance premiums have fallen by 17 per cent between 2017 and 2021. Recent Central Statistics Office (CSO) figures show a further 10 per cent decrease in the year to date following one of the most significant reforms from the Government\u2019s Action Plan for Insurance Reform, the Personal Injuries Guidelines introduced in 2021. Average motor insurance premium peaked at \u20ac710 in the fourth quarter of 2017, fell to \u20ac590 in the fourth quarter of last year and, according to the CSO, there has been a further drop of 10 per cent in the year to date Average motor insurance premium peaked at \u20ac710 in Q4 2017, fell to \u20ac590 in Q4 2021 and the further drop of 10 per cent in 2022 reported by the CSO figures also comes against a backdrop of rising prices in almost every other sector.\u201d In terms of profitability, everyone in business knows that this is fundamental to their existence. A business or market that consistently can\u2019t return a profit eventually ceases to exist. Moreover, a profitable and healthy insurance market is essential to the successful running of the wider economy, able to fulfil its role supporting consumer and business activity on a daily and weekly basis. A profitable, healthy insurance market is also likely to bring more competition to the market, offering customers more choice, more products and more services. While last week\u2019s NCID report shows healthy profit levels for insurers in 2021, this is a market that is cyclical in nature and a wider analysis of the figures over the past 13 years shows average profitability in the sector of 4 per cent, which includes operating profits and losses. The cost of insurance is a key concern for consumers, so it is positive to see motor premiums falling for a fifth consecutive year. We have consistently supported and worked with Government on the introduction of reforms to reduce market volatility and bring more consistency for policyholders. The falling motor premiums shown in last week\u2019s report from the Central Bank also provide clear evidence that the benefits of these reforms are beginning to be realised and consumers are benefiting. This is in contrast to many other sectors of the economy where inflation is taking hold and prices are rising. Cost of claims One of the key purposes of the Government\u2019s Action Plan for Insurance Reform was to address the high cost of claims, which Insurance Ireland had been raising concerns about for a number of years. These concerns were borne out by the 2018 report of the Personal Injuries Commission, led by Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns, which highlighted the fact that, for example, payments for soft-tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in the UK, and ultimately led to the very welcome introduction of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. What we are now seeing emerge is the positive impact of the new guidelines in the motor insurance market, with the public liability and employers\u2019 liability markets remaining problematic. The NCID report on these segments of the insurance market, published in June, analysed more than 328,000 policies and showed that the employers\u2019 liability, public liability and commercial property markets have been very challenging markets for insurers over the past decade. The average premium for the majority of policies (84 per cent) increased by 6 per cent from \u20ac2,232 in 2009 to \u20ac2,356 in 2020, an 11-year period, but insurers\u2019 operating result for this sector of the market was a loss of 11 per cent in 2020. I should point out that the figure of a 6 per cent increase comes from the NCID report and its analysis of the total market and is less than the figure of 16 per cent which is often quoted by the Alliance for Insurance Reform but is not based on the total market but on a small sample size of fewer than 500 policy holders. While good progress has been made in overall market reform, it is essential that the other measures in the Government\u2019s action plan continue to be progressed. These include the strengthening of the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), which is under way through the publication in August of the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, and the rebalancing of the duty of care and increased competition in the market. These are the elements which we believe will help to take the volatility out of the employers, public and commercial property liability market segments, making them more viable for insurers and attracting more competition. It\u2019s interesting to note that claimants received roughly the same level of award whether opting for litigation or PIAB The latest data from PIAB, published earlier this month, shows a more positive trend emerging in 2022 in terms of claimants accepting PIAB awards, but the proportion of cases going through litigation remains far too high. It is concerning to see a decline in the proportion of claimants using PIAB (15 per cent), accounting for only 8 per cent of total injury claims costs. The cost of litigation is still very high. For claims less than \u20ac100K, legal fees in the litigation channel accounted for 40 per cent of total claims costs in 2021 whereas legal fees in the PIAB channel accounted for only 4 per cent of total claims costs. It\u2019s interesting to note that claimants received roughly the same level of award whether opting for litigation or PIAB. In order to bring about further premium reductions, it is important that more cases are resolved through PIAB and less through litigation. Much has been achieved to date through the Government\u2019s Action Plan and it is important that momentum is not lost. It is essential that the outstanding measures are prioritised and completed for the benefit of consumers and the economy. Moyagh Murdock is chief executive of Insurance Ireland.",

            "raw_text": "A move by a UK-based insurance company to withdraw cover for countryside pursuits could succeed where thousands of protestors over many decades have failed by bringing a stop to fox and hare hunting in Ireland. The Meath Hunt has been running for more than 200 years but its chairman Graham O\u2019Reilly said its annual St Stephen\u2019s Day hunt had to be abandoned because it was unable to find an insurance company to cover the event. In November the primary insurer in Ireland, a UK-based subsidiary of US parent company Liberty Mutual, announced that it would no longer renew policies in Ireland blaming high claims costs for the move. Liberty Insurance Ireland left the commercial market here two years ago, leaving no Irish-based insurance underwriter for the sport. Insurance costs for clubs over the past year for race meetings have doubled or tripled, in some cases bringing premiums to \u20ac12,000 or more. Before Christmas, meetings were held between Government officials and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, insurance industry representatives and hunt clubs but without resolution. Mr O\u2019Reilly said there was \u201cno-one to fill the gap\u201d and the Meath Hunt had been effectively stopped as a result. He said the insurance difficulties would have serious implications for not only hunting but the wider equine industry with over 14,000 jobs now at risk. He added that it would also have consequences for point to point racing as well as for National Hunt racing industry. He said hunts across the country were trying to come up with alternative solutions but he could not say when or if the horses and dogs in his pack would be allowed to run again. \u201cI think the insurance companies are after the low hanging fruit, public liability or fire insurance and they see covering outdoor pursuits as higher risk,\u201d he told The Irish Times. \u201cHunters can sometimes draw adverse publicity but it is a tradition in Ireland,\u201d he continued. However he said hunting did have considerable support suggesting that tens of thousands of people come to watch the hunt - or \u201cthe lovely spectacle\u201d as he called it - in Meath each Christmas. It has been run since 1817 and his family have been involved since the very beginning. He himself has been hunting for more than 40 years and had never seen a fox killed, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it cruel in the slightest, it is part of our culture and in our DNA. I know that there are urban elements who are anti-blood sports but at this stage it is not really a blood sport at all. I have never seen a fox killed and I have been hunting since I was seven years old.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Accountants and lawyers earned fees of about \u20ac100 million from the demise of Quinn Insurance, according to figures showing the company\u2019s collapse proved to be something of a bonanza for insolvency experts and their advisers. The 2010 implosion of the company established by bankrupt former billionaire Se\u00e1n Quinn left taxpayers on the hook for \u20ac1 billion in losses, with surcharges on home and motor policies to fund State compensation for failed insurers. But an analysis of public and private data shows how Quinn Insurance \u2013 and litigation linked to it \u2013 became a lucrative source of fees for 13 years after ministers placed it in administration under Michael McAteer and Paul McCann, partners in accountants Grant Thornton. The insurer was formally wound up on Monday  with a High Court liquidation order, the final chapter in a saga that began when Mr Quinn lost control of an empire straddling cement, manufacturing, property, hospitality and bank interests.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Grant Thornton declined to release 22 reports the administrators gave the court, setting out their work and tens of millions of euro in fees they received and paid out to legal and other advisers such as merchant bankers. The administrators\u2019 solicitors McCann FitzGerald also declined access. Despite high costs to taxpayers, their stance raises questions as to how reports on a court-mandated administration can be opened for public scrutiny. Still, Companies Registration Office filings set out large fee payments to the administrators from their appointment at the height of the financial crisis. Such data follows figures in the administrators\u2019 23rd and final report to the court in March. [\u00a0 Quinn Insurance administrators got \u20ac375 per hour over 10 years for their work \u00a0] Grant Thornton received \u20ac37.6 million including VAT between 2010 and 2023, excluding an 18-month period in 2021-2022 for which figures are still not public. The administrators incurred almost \u20ac3.5 million in legal fees after July 2022 and \u20ac9.09 million in \u201clegal and other fees\u201d in 2010-2012. They made \u201clegal provisions\u201d for \u20ac32.47 million in litigation costs in 2012-2015 but actual costs remain unclear. The provisions were linked to court action against former Quinn Insurance auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers for alleged negligent auditing. PwC denied the claims but paid \u20ac54 million last year to settle the case, \u201cinclusive\u201d of the administrators\u2019 costs. PwC\u2019s legal fees were \u20ac25 million. Grant Thornton declined requests to release the reports but said they \u201cshould be available\u201d by asking the court. The Irish Times approached the Courts Service for the papers, citing laws to support \u201cfair and accurate reporting.\u201d However, the court said it could not release them because exhibits such as the reports were not in the case file. Grant Thornton said: \u201cThe joint administrators, as appointees of the High Court, provided progress reports to the court over the duration of the administration. These reports were considered by the High Court at every point of the process.

            "date": "2022-03-29",
            "raw_text": "US insurer AIG has filed for a long-expected initial public offering of its life and asset management business that could value the unit, to be called Corebridge Financial, at more than $20 billion (\u20ac18 billion). The company, which will have $410 billionn in assets under management, is by far the largest to publicly file for a US IPO this year. Market volatility caused by concerns about rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine led many candidates to put their plans on hold. Companies have raised just $2.4 billion in US listings in 2022 in the slowest quarter since early 2016. Comparisons AIG\u2019s split was first promised in 2020 as part of a plan to revive its flagging fortunes. The company is the only big US insurer to combine life with property and casualty units, impeding comparisons with peers. The life and asset management business is known as SAFG, but AIG said it would be rebranded as Corebridge after the IPO. It sells individual and group retirement saving products as well as life insurance. \u201cAs Corebridge, we will continue to proudly partner with financial and retirement professionals to help their clients feel confident and motivated today, and in control of their tomorrow,\u201d said Kevin Hogan, chief executive of AIG\u2019s life and retirement business. The S-1 registration statement filed on Monday did not give a value for Corebridge, but people familiar with the process put the figure at about $20 billion. This is consistent with the $2.2 billion that Blackstone paid in November for a nearly 10 per cent stake in SAFG. Lead bankers JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. AIG has been undergoing bouts of restructuring since its $185 billion taxpayer rescue during the 2008 financial crisis, selling off assets in areas such as aircraft leasing and consumer finance. Between 2015 and 2017, it fought off pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson to separate its general insurance and life businesses. But management changed its mind a few years later. The move also comes amid a broader rethink in the sector of the old conglomerate model, with insurers such as London and Hong Kong-listed Prudential choosing to break up sprawling groups into local units. Management Hours before filing the S-1, AIG announced plans to hand over management of up to $150 billion of fixed income and private placement assets to BlackRock, in one of the largest such mandates of its kind. About $90 billion of the assets will become part of Corebridge\u2019s portfolio and $60 billion is within AIG\u2019s core business. More pension funds, endowments and insurers are turning to these types of arrangements, often dubbed \u201coutsourced chief investment officer\u201d deals. They allow the asset owners to tap outside investing expertise and potentially cut costs by handing regulatory and operating responsibilities to a larger fund manager, such as BlackRock. As of March last year, almost $2.5 trillionn in assets were being managed under OCIO arrangements, up 22 per cent year on year, according to an annual industry survey by Pensions & Investments. AIG previously agreed to hand off management of up to $92 billion in life and retirement assets to Blackstone at the time the latter took its stake in SAFG. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with assets under management of $10tn at end of 2021, was fourth last year in terms of fully discretionary assets managed through such outsourced CIO arrangements, and it has been expanding its reach into the area. Investment The group last year took over management of more than \u00a321.5 billion (\u20ac25.7 billion) in pension assets from British Airways, and Gary Shedlin, BlackRock chief financial officer, predicted at a December conference that more large deals were to come. \"You're starting to see some and . . . we're talking $50 billion mandates. We are really uniquely positioned to be able to leverage the entire firm,\" he said. The AIG-BlackRock arrangement will be phased in gradually and is subject to regulatory approvals. Both Corebridge and the rest of AIG will use BlackRock\u2019s investment management technology, known as Aladdin. \u201cBlackRock is honoured to have been selected to serve AIG as a strategic partner. We look forward to leveraging our investment expertise, scale, and technology capabilities for the benefit of all of AIG\u2019s stakeholders,\u201d Rob Kapito, BlackRock president, said in the deal announcement. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022",

Stuart Insurances, based in Blackrock in south Co Dublin and with offices in Kilkenny and Wexford, is involved in both business and commercial coverage and is understood to write about \u20ac20 million of gross written premiums a year. It was established in 1978, and the company\u2019s workforce of more than 30 people, led by managing director Ian Stuart, will join Arachas\u2019s 500-strong workforce throughout the State. Arachas, one of the most active dealmakers in the industry in the Republic, was itself acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a UK brokerage group that is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Partners, for \u20ac250 million. Still, it is the first deal done by Arachas since last October, when it closed the purchase of Waterford-based Hooper Dolan, bringing the group\u2019s annual gross written premiums to about \u20ac450 million.

The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. A Central Bank report published last week on employers\u2019 and public liability and commercial property insurance showed that broker commissions across these three lines of coverage \u2014 usually sold as a package \u2014 equated to 16 per cent of insurance underwriters\u2019 gross earned premiums in 2019 and 2020. \u201cOver the last number of years, we have been pursued by a number of interested parties but felt that the cultural fit and timing was not right,\u201d said Mr Stuart. \u201cOnce we started talking to Arachas, we quickly understood the opportunities there would be for our team of over 30 professionals and the advantages that being part of the Arachas group would have for our long-standing and loyal customers.\u201d Arachas chief executive Conor Brennan said that the deal \u201cis about growth for both sides and will present great development opportunities for Stuart Insurances employees as they become part of the Arachas family and for their customers, as they benefit from a greater range of quality insurance products\u201d.",

However, for many of its members, the price increases looming will be even worse than that. [\u00a0 Health insurance: How to save hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 on your policy \u00a0] One customer who contacted The Irish Times said the cost of a policy covering two adults and a child was climbing from \u20ac2,550 to \u20ac2,950, an increase of just over 15 per cent. A spokeswoman for Laya said the scale of the increase was as a result of the price hike that will be applied to the policy from October and the increase it announced in April of this year. \u201cWe have tried to minimise the impact of premium increases on our members. However, we need to ensure that we\u2019re serving the current and future healthcare needs of our members, striking a balance of keeping premiums affordable while meeting the growing needs of our 690,000 members and giving them rapid access to more hospitals, consultants and urgent care services when they need it,\u201d she said. [\u00a0 Axa to buy Laya Healthcare in \u20ac650m deal \u00a0] Caught off guard Health insurance expert Dermott Goode of  totalhealthcover.ie  warned that the scale of the price increases in the months ahead will catch many people off guard. \u201cThere is a big shock coming to a lot of consumers from October,\u201d he said. Mr Goode added that companies use averages when outlining price increases, a practice that could give some people a false sense of comfort. He noted Laya had announced an average increase of less than 5 per cent in April and then a further 3 per cent was announced earlier this month to take effect in October. \u201cHowever some plans in April went up by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent,\u201d said Mr Goode. \u201cThe cumulative effect of the two price increases means that thousands of consumers could be facing [an] increase of anything from 10 to 15 per cent. It is the same with Irish Life and we are seeing cumulative increase of 13 and 14 per cent.\u201d Move on prices Mr Goode warned that  VHI , the largest provider of private health insurance in the State with more than 1.1 million subscribers, was likely to move on prices soon. \u201cI am expecting them to announce something similar to Laya soon so its customers will not be immune either,\u201d he said. VHI did not respond to queries from The Irish Times about the matter. What this means, based on the spread of renewal dates for policyholders across the industry, said Mr Goode, is that \u201cthe one million people who are going to renew before the end of February need to brace themselves for double-digit price increases depending on the plan that they have\u201d.",

            "raw_text": "The car insurance industry here could save \u20ac287 million in reduced claims as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. That is according to a report by insurance comparison platform HelloSafe, which says Irish policyholders may be entitled to expect a discount on their premiums in the future. The report estimates that the reduction in daily commutes and road journeys caused by two national lockdowns and various restrictions to contain the virus has resulted in a 35 per cent decrease in car insurance claims in the Republic. This corresponds to an annual saving for insurers of \u20ac287.2 million over 2020 in comparison with 2019. Using data from the National Claims Information Database (NCID) as well as information from individual insurance firms, HelloSafe estimated the likely reduction in claims on a national scale and on a county-by-county level. The study found that claims have decreased most in urbanised areas. Dublin had the largest decrease with an estimated 49.2 per cent drop for the year, equivalent to a saving of \u20ac113 million for insurers there. Galway (-35.6 per cent), Cork (-34.5 per cent) and Limerick (-31.2 per cent) also saw big reductions in claims. The counties of Kildare (-35 per cent), Offaly (-30 per cent ) and Laois (-29.5 per cent), which were put under local lockdowns before the whole country, also appear to have high decrease rates in car-related claims. HelloSafe said the change in driving habits during lockdown modified the risk assumptions used by insurance companies to calculate insurance premiums. \u201cBecause of the reduction in traffic, Irish drivers were less at risk than expected during the whole year and thus represented a lower cost to insurers,\u201d it said. With average annual motor insurance premiums still relatively high by international standards \u2013 \u20ac653 at the end of 2019, according to NCID \u2013 policy-holders here may be entitled to expect a discount on their premiums in the long run, the company said. Lockdown \"With most people stuck at home their cars have inevitably stayed in the garage,\" said Antoine Fruchard, insurance expert and HelloSafe chief executive. \u201cWhen the lockdown will be over and people will start going out again, the number of cars on the road is likely to increase back at pre-Covid levels,\u201d he said. \u201c However, it is likely that customers will question why they continued to pay such high insurance premiums whilst they weren\u2019t able to drive. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if all the insurance companies will make more refunds or which other kind of discount they will offer,\u201d Mr Fruchard said. \"Competition between them may be increasing in the coming months, and that means customers should see a slight drop in car insurance premiums \u2013 which would be fair given the economic crisis which may catch Ireland in the post-Covid world.\"",

Just more than five weeks ago Elaine Donnelly was involved in \u201ca very minor incident where my car door hit another car door in a car park. A scuff mark existed which disappeared after polishing with a wet finger.\u201d What happened next highlights much of what is wrong with the insurance industry in Ireland. \u201cThe other driver became irate and took a photo of my insurance details. I photographed the scuff mark on the other car, and there was no damage to my car,\u201d she says. \u201cI contacted my insurer to inform them, in case of a fraudulent claim. No claim has been made to date by the other driver. Indeed, if one were to be made, my excess of \u20ac300 would more than cover the cost.\u201d But the story does not end there. \u201cMeanwhile, my insurance renewal quote has been issued, and my premium has jumped from \u20ac487 to \u20ac1,276, a price gouging sum. I have full no claims bonus protection, with 10-years-plus no claims \u2013 18 in fact, but not counted. My insurer has also stated on my no claims cert that I am at fault for a car accident with a claim outstanding. Thereby, preventing me from shopping around for a more competitive quote elsewhere. Apparently, there is no difference between a minor incident involving a car door in a car park and a motor crash that causes significant damage and injury. Informing my insurance company was on paper the right thing to do. However, in practice, [it comes with] a high cost to me in monetary and stress-inducing terms.\u201d Auto pilot Meanwhile, Gerald Duffy asked us to \u201cgive a big shoutout to VHI travel insurance\u201d, but before the company gets out the champagne to celebrate some good news, it should probably know that he said that with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. He was prompted to mail us after getting an email confirming that his annual VHI travel insurance would auto-renew at the end of the month and the cost would be automatically deducted from his credit card. \u201cI had to phone VHI and cancel, and they even then tried to put me off, telling me that I would have access to exclusive airport lounges etc,\u201d he writes. \u201cA friend of mine only discovered his VHI travel insurance renewed in April at the height of travel restrictions when he looked at his Visa bill. Irate, he phoned them up and got a refund. Anyway, can you give a big shoutout to VHI travel, and their auto travel insurance renewal policies. \u2018We are all in this together\u2019, except of course VHI, who are in this for the profits.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "From the side streets at a parade to a witnessed moment of love, the sniff of a dog to an off-duty cop: street photography captures life in all its glorious, random moments. Preserving the intimate, the tender, the outrageous and the beautiful, the art form offers an insightful parallel to more official takes on life such as the news. A new festival turns its lens on this vibrant art, with exhibitions, workshops and talks, but what makes street photography different? \u201cThere\u2019s a crossover between photojournalism and documentary photography,\u201d says award-winning photographer and  Dublin Street Photography Festival  co-director Des Byrne. According to Byrne, photojournalism is about narrating events, but \u201cstreet photography is an art form.\u201d Growing up, a photographer living on his street in  Bray , Co Wicklow, fascinated him, but \u201ccoming from a working-class background, I couldn\u2019t afford to get film developed.\u201d Digital has changed that, of course, and has put cameras into the hands of almost every adult in Ireland. Everyone, he says, even the most illustrious of photographers, takes bad shots, but when you get a good one, there\u2019s nothing like it. [\u00a0 The man on the bridge: the Ukrainian photographer who captured life on Dublin\u2019s O\u2019Connell Street \u00a0] [\u00a0 Capturing the faces of Dublin\u2019s inner city as the streets change around them \u00a0] Street photography is increasing in popularity, says Byrne, who adds that legislation differs from country to country. In Ireland there is no law against taking photographs of people in public places, and that includes children, but harassment is illegal, and you need to obtain consent if you\u2019re planning to use someone\u2019s image for commercial purposes. One of Byrne\u2019s heroes is renowned New York photographer Jill Freedman, who died in 2019, and the festival includes a retrospective of her work. Freedman taught herself photography, to tell, as she put it, \u201ca story in the blink of an eye\u201d. Her work took her to the Resurrection City shantytown erected in Washington DC on the assassination of Martin Luther King, to SoHo and Studio 54, to Harlem and the Bronx, photographing police and firefighters, to Holocaust sites in Europe. It also brought her to Ireland. \u201cI loved the gentleness, the sweet shyness, the warm welcomes,\u201d she wrote, but added: \u201ceach time I return I see the changes, the ugly noisy modern world.\u201d So what makes a good snap? Below, street photographers give their thoughts on 10 examples of the art: 1. 42nd Street, New York, 2018, by Melissa O\u2019Shaughnessy 1. 42nd Street, New York, 2018, by Melissa O\u2019Shaughnessy The subject of the image is a strong woman full of poise and grace. She is looking intently at something, and her gaze is echoed by the man in the baseball cap behind her. Meanwhile the others in the scene are unaware of whatever is happening off camera. The composition is perfectly balanced by having two women and a man on each side of the central character. \u2013 Paul Murray 2. Hawk on Bus by Tony O\u2019Shea 2. Hawk on Bus by Tony O\u2019Shea For me, this image occupies that great space where documentary meets street photography, evoking feelings of  Ken Loach \u2019s classic 1969 film, Kes. I love the sense of the \u201cunusual in the usual\u201d \u2013 two boys sitting on a bus, separated by a bird of prey; the brace on the teeth of the guy in the left suggests a sense of sort of awkward innocence, as does the cheeky smile of the boy in front of him. \u2013 Brian Lloyd Duckett [\u00a0 Another Ireland: the revealing photographs of Tony O\u2019Shea \u00a0] 3. Men drink beer in a public market in Cruzeiro neighbourhood in Bras\u00edlia, by Gustavo Minas 3. Men drink beer in a public market in Cruzeiro neighbourhood in Bras\u00edlia, by Gustavo Minas A good street photograph is one where the elements align in an interesting and aesthetic way. Besides the lush exquisite colours of this scene in Bras\u00edlia, it is the excellent narrative. The past and the present, two friends chatting and hanging out with the shadow of youth not far away. \u2013 Danielle Houghton 4. Oxford Street, London, by Matthew Stuart 4. Oxford Street, London, by Matthew Stuart Matt Stuart is a master of capturing moments in life that other people would overlook. What is interesting is the way he has juxtaposed the image of the serious male model looking down on the group. This technique helps give the viewer a hint as to what Stuart was looking at. \u2013 Paul Murray 5. Valencia by Polly Rusyn 5. Valencia by Polly Rusyn Filling the frame is a technique that is used a lot in street photography. This image taken in Valencia is a great example. Polly Rusyn has used every edge of the frame, starting with a central idea of having the bollard become a seat for the driving woman. Rusyn waited for a second figure to enter the image in the lower right. To have the older lady appear wearing matching sunglasses and a set of sparkly antlers is like divine intervention. \u2013 Paul Murray 6: Train, NYC, by Richard Sandler 6: Train, NYC, by Richard Sandler I often use this image as an example when I\u2019m talking to students about street photography. I love the mirror-image effect, making it almost a diptych. The pole running down the middle creates tension and invites the viewer firstly to decide whether there\u2019s some Photoshop trickery going on and, secondly, to create their own story about the lives of the four subjects. \u2013 Brian Lloyd Duckett 7: On the London Underground by Shane Taylor 7: On the London Underground by Shane Taylor What is good about this photograph is the timeless quality. If it weren\u2019t for the hint of the people with masks to the right, we could imagine this being decades old. Here, such a lovely tender moment was caught by the photographer, making us wonder if she was giving comfort, or was she the one seeking support. \u2013 Danielle Houghton 8: London, by Lloyd Duckett 8: London, by Lloyd Duckett Animals are such a fun, historic part of street photography. Dogs acting in a human way are irresistible and this \u201cmango courier\u201d dog delivers that way. His elegant cross-paw pose, and his weary gaze out to traffic, as if he is resigned to rush hour, makes this a great capture. \u2013 Danielle Houghton 9. Strangers Powered by Horsefeed in the Phoenix Park, by Danielle Houghton 9. Strangers Powered by Horsefeed in the Phoenix Park, by Danielle Houghton Subjects look in various directions, including one that engages the viewer directly. Danielle\u2019s image highlights the significance of gaze direction, a timeless aspect of image-making known for its ability to guide the viewer\u2019s eyes around a frame. \u2013 Kevin Lim 10 Berlin, by Martin U Waltz 10 Berlin, by Martin U Waltz The visual trope, known as \u201cR\u00fcckenfigur\u201d [showing a person from behind, in the foreground of the image] is rooted in the tradition of German Romanticism, inviting reflection upon the enigmatic journey that lies ahead.

            "raw_text": "Hundreds of thousands of consumers could be paying over the odds for reduced levels of health insurance cover because they are afraid to shop around, the head of the authority governing the sector has warned. Annual savings amounting to hundreds of euro are available to many who switch health insurance policies, but more than one million have never looked for better value, according to the chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), Laura Brien. Ms Brien cited as-yet unpublished research carried out by the HIA which has found that just one third of people with private health insurance had ever switched, with most having only done so once. The figures mean that in excess of 1.2 million people have never switched policy. \u201cPeople are worried more about what they might lose rather than thinking about what they might gain,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are concerned that if they switch they might lose access to certain hospitals or consultants or not have the same level of cover that they previously had.\u201d Waiting periods She also noted a widespread misunderstanding about how waiting periods are applied by insurers. \u201cPeople think that waiting periods start again if they switch but that is not the case,\u201d she said. Once a person has a certain level of cover with one company, if they switch to a different policy then waiting periods only apply for any enhanced cover offered, she explained. She said the HIA\u2019s research suggests one reason people do not want to make changes is because it seems complicated and there are multiple things to consider. \u201cThat can lead people to make no decision because they are worried about making the wrong decision.\u201d She stopped short of saying health insurers were exploiting the complexity of health insurance to increase their profits, but said they were \u201cnot trying to simplify things\u201d. Ms Brien pointed out that not only have prices gone up over recent years for many policies, but the level of cover offered by companies has changed, which could leave consumers facing substantial bills for future treatments.",

            "raw_text": "Ireland\u2019s ability to attract top international music acts could be threatened by continuing high insurance costs in a world where new music venues are coming on stream and fans are willing to travel to see their favourite acts, music promoter, Peter Aiken has warned. Mr Aiken said that while the live music industry has recovered well from the impact of Covid-19 and tickets sales last year for major stars like Garth Brooks were strong, he was concerned that insurance costs in Ireland might see some major international stars opting to play elsewhere rather than here. \u201cWe are a little bit sheepish saying it because every other industry is struggling because of the cost of living but live music is back and concert tickets are flying. There is a great gra in particular for Irish music like Lankum, the Mary Wallopers and it\u2019s kids that are going and tickets sales are very strong.\u201d Speaking in Cork at a press conference to announce Rod Stewart appearing at the Live in Marquee, Mr Aiken instanced his experience when he brought Stewart to the 3Arena in Dublin in November when compared to bringing Stewart at the same show at the SSE Arena in Belfast in December.

But the judges aren\u2019t as quick any more to issue [awards] and the insurance brokers are now fighting [bogus claims]. It was a bit of a racket between the insurance brokers and the lawyers in trying to settle but they are now fighting back. \u201cIt is expensive \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you heard Eddie Hearn [boxer Katie Taylor\u2019s promoter)] on the radio this morning complaining about Croke Park. It is expensive \u2013 it is costly to do stuff [in Ireland]. The Point is a costly venue to rent and stadiums are dear,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the world is a much bigger place [in terms of venues] now than it was 20 years ago \u2013 you look at Saudi Arabia and Dubai as proper concert venues, they\u2019ve built proper stadiums there \u2013 look at the World Cup and how fans were willing to travel to Qatar for that.\u201d Asked how much longer he hopes to run the Live at the Marquee series in the Cork Docklands, Mr Aiken said it all depends on what happens in terms of the immediate development of the area which is earmarked by Cork City Council for housing. \u201cEvery year we say it may be the last, but we keep going \u2013 until there is a clear plan what they are going to down there, we won\u2019t know but it could go for a few more years yet \u2013 Live in the Marquee has been great for me, and it\u2019s been great for the city.\u201d \u201cI never thought when I started it back in 2005 and I had Brian Wilson and Diana Ross when I was sort of bailing out the City of Culture, I never thought back then that I would still be going 18 years later but over 1.2 million people have been to see concerts there.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Insurance is a game of inertia. Getting customers to sign up in the first place is the key. Once you have them, they tend to be slow to move as Irish data on consumer switching activity on utilities and banks show. The same is undoubtedly true for health insurance, a sector where the 350 plan options for consumers must prove intimidating for anyone looking to examine their options for better value in the market. According to the most recent report of the  Health Insurance Authority  (HIA), which regulates the sector, queries from consumers about switching plans accounted for significantly less than 1 per cent of the calls it dealt with. The auto-enrolment pension scheme seems good on paper, but how will it actually work? Where inertia is king, the last thing any business wants to do is give customers cause to reconsider their position. Yet this is precisely what Ireland\u2019s largest private health insurer,  VHI , has done in announcing that it is axing four of its plans, including two that rank among its most long-standing and popular with consumers \u2014 Health Plus Access and Health Plus Extra, formerly known as Plan B and Plan B Options. In the process, VHI is giving 130,000 consumers (close to 11 per cent of its customers) a reason to look at alternatives, including those offered by its rivals in the sector \u2014 Laya Health and Irish Life Health. Industry analysts note that VHI offers more modern plans that are largely similar in the cover they offer at broadly similar prices. But they do not rank among the 30 private health plans that account for 50 per cent of the State\u2019s 2.5 million private health insurance customers, according to the HIA. Two of the four plans being shut down do. So here\u2019s the thing. If, as VHI says, it is looking to deliver \u201ca simplified product structure\u201d, why not simplify its offerings by shutting down the less popular, but broadly similar plans? And if it is focusing on \u201cenhanced offerings to better meet member\u2019s needs\u201d as it professes, it could surely just amend the cover available under the existing popular plans as it already does regularly, and keep playing to that customer inertia.

            "raw_text": "Aviva\u2019s Irish general insurance unit reported on Thursday that its operating profit fell almost 26 per cent last year, amid rising motor and other claims following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and as general inflationary pressures weighed. Aviva Insurance Ireland\u2019s operating profit fell to \u20ac32 million from \u20ac43 million the previous year, with its combined operating ratio \u2013 a gauge that compares claims, costs and expenses as a percentage of premiums \u2013 rising to 95.8 per cent from 91.7 per cent. A figure below 100 per cent indicates an insurer is writing business at a profit. Insurance companies typically target a ratio of 90-95 per cent in a functioning market. Why are Irish companies shifting their stock listings to the United States? Gross written premiums increased by 4.4 per cent to \u20ac495 million, due to strong growth in the company\u2019s commercial lines business offset by a reduction in personal lines motor business. Average motor premiums declined by 9 per cent to 2022, and have fallen by 40 per cent from their peak in 2016, the company said. \u201cWe dropped prices in anticipation of both reduced compensation payments and reduced litigation following the introduction of the new personal injury guidelines by the Judicial Council nearly two years ago,\u201d said Aviva Insurance Ireland chief executive Declan O\u2019Rourke, referring to guidelines published in 2021, which have subsequently seen average awards by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) fall significantly. Mr O\u2019Rourke said that while Aviva\u2019s expectation was that the guidelines would reduce the number of PIAB assessments being rejected and litigated, the level of rejections has since risen from 50 per cent to 61 per cent of motor claims, \u201ceroding the benefits of reform\u201d. \u201cThe average legal costs in a litigated case involving minor injuries are over \u20ac16,000 versus zero if the case is settled in PIAB.   Aviva urges the Government to review their reforms in order to address the high rejection rates of PIAB assessments and significant inconsistencies between PIAB assessments and court awards,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Aviva Life and Pensions Ireland, led by chief executive David Swanton, saw operating profit surge to \u20ac60 million last year from \u20ac14 million in 2021, driven by \u201cimproved underlying profits, reduced expenses and modelling improvements\u201d. [\u00a0 Why personal injuries claims are plummeting in the High Court \u00a0] New business volumes, measured as annual premium equivalent, rose to \u20ac242 million from \u20ac230 million. The wider London-listed Aviva group reported a 35 per cent rise in full-year operating profit from continuing operations to \u00a32.2 billion (\u20ac2.5 billion) and said that its proposed final dividend for 2022 would bring its total payout per share for the year to 31p from 22p for 2021. The group also promised to carry out a \u00a3300 million share buyback amid pressure from Swedish activist investor Cevian to boost returns. The insurer and asset manager said it had paid more than \u00a35 billion to investors since 2021. Cevian, best known in Dublin stock market circles for its 4 per cent stake in building materials giant CRH, first revealed a holding in Aviva in 2021. It said on Thursday that the results showed the company had made a \u201cstrong start to the next phase\u201d, which it said was delivering on Aviva\u2019s long-term potential.",

            "raw_text": "One of the first places that people in search of better value health insurance go to is the Health Insurance Authority's website  hia.ie , an organisation headed up by Laura Brien. She says recent research suggests that about one-third of those with private health insurance have switched although most have made the switch only once and says that while the numbers switching have increased, the increase is a \u201cslow burner\u201d rather than anything more dramatic. \u201cPeople are worried more about what they might lose rather than thinking about what they might gain,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are concerned that if they switch, they might lose access to certain hospitals or consultants or not have the same level of cover that they previously had. \u201cPeople think that waiting periods start again if they switch but that is not the case,\u201d she says. If a person has a certain level of cover with one company and they switch companies or to a different policy with their existing company, waiting periods apply only for any enhanced cover offered by their new policy. They do not apply to any cover that was offered by their previous policy. That means that if a person has 90 per cent cover for cardiac care with a particular policy and switch to a policy that has 100 per cent cover for cardiac care, they will continue to have 90 per cent cover for that care from the moment they switch but will have to wait a set period before the benefit of the additional 10 per cent cover kicks in. While she says she is agnostic about people choosing company A over company B or company C, she is evangelical about \u201censuring people are able to get the best level of cover at the most affordable price. It is all about looking at the cover you have and asking if you are getting what you need for the price you are paying,\u201d she says. She says that not only have prices gone up over recent years for many policies but the level of cover offered by those policies has changed. \u201cIt is a cumulative thing that happens over time,\u201d she says. \u201cThe biggest thing we have seen is the excesses increasing and that can be to the detriment of the consumer. If a 10 per cent excess on a policy goes up to 20 per cent, then that can amount to big money for someone if they fall ill. That is where the biggest differences in the level of cover is happening.\u201d People over the age of 65 pay 34 per cent more for their cover than younger people She highlights how companies tend to focus all of their marketing and advertising at younger more profitable cohorts. \u201cIf you look at a health insurance ad, do you ever see someone over 65 or do you ever see an image of an ambulance outside someone\u2019s house? No, it is always ads featuring young healthy people or families playing with their children in the playground. The companies are advertising to younger people because they make more money from them.\u201d Brien says that people over the age of 65 pay 34 per cent more for their cover than younger people. She says some of this is because older people seek more cover which costs more but it is also because \u201cthey have been on the same plans for many years\u201d. The companies have rolled out multiple price increases in recent years blaming medical inflation and the higher cost of improved treatments. \u201cNot all plans are going up by the same amounts and we have seen price increases of 2-3 per cent on some lower cost plans while the higher end plans are going up by more than 6 per cent,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople need to look at the benefits of their plans and see if there are any comparable plans that cost less.\u201d Brien says there are things that have pushed up costs including the Covid response across the healthcare sector as well as advances in technology and drugs but suggests that \u201cat the same time certain practices have changed because of Covid and you would expect they would lead to costs going down. For example, hospitals are more interested in getting people in and out fast so instead of spending five nights in hospital, patients might be spending four and there are more day cases because people do not want to spend that extra time in hospital.\u201d She also points to a lack of \u201ccompetitive pressure\u201d across the private hospital sector. \u201cEven if three new private hospitals were to open tomorrow, they would be full at almost any price point so there is not a lot of competitive pressure and there is unlikely to be unless there is excess capacity.\u201d She points to Covid which has seen capacity in private hospitals reduced and cites the example of the Netherlands where almost everyone has private health insurers while less than 50 per cent of Irish adults have private policies. \u201cHere the companies are focused on bringing more people into the market whereas in the Netherlands the focus is on beating up the suppliers on price.\u201d Other options Not everyone wants or can afford health insurance and there are other options. One of them is Vigo Health, an Irish company set up last year to address a gap in the private everyday health market through a combination of strong digital healthcare and cash benefits. The company says it is designed for people under the age of 40 who don\u2019t have hospital insurance. Chief executive Ruth Bailey says that for less than \u20ac10 a week people can get access to digital healthcare options including virtual and WhatsApp consultations with nurses, doctors, as well as physio and mental health professionals. It also offers full cover for MRI and CT scans as well as two visits to a minor injury clinic. There is also up to \u20ac300 a year for blood tests and X-rays and up to \u20ac500 a year for consultant visits. It does not cover hospital stays. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compare ourselves to hospital health insurance and it is not a replacement for that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe market we are looking at is the 25-35s. The under-25s are more likely to be on their parents\u2019 policies or just don\u2019t care while the over-35s\u2019 lifetime community rating kicks in.\u201d She says that just because this cohort are not buying health insurance \u201cdoes not mean they have hospital needs on an outpatient basis. And with this you have the flexibility of getting everyday costs and access to fast diagnosis.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "US brokerage behemoth Gallagher\u2019s acquisition of Irish insurance group Innovu seems likely to be a harbinger of more upheaval across the Irish brokerage landscape. It has already undergone radical transformation in recent years amid an unprecedented wave of consolidation. Backed by MML Capital Partners, Innovu was one of several Irish outfits, bankrolled by private equity, to wade waist-deep into the market, snapping up as many smaller, independent brokers as they could over the past four years or so. In that time frame, Innovu acquired five regional brokers \u2014 Sheridan Insurances, Wexford Insurances, Goggin Insurance Brokers, and Cullen Insurances and Wexford-based PE Kelly Insurances in October last year. Now with the backing of Gallagher \u2014 which boasts a stock market value in excess of $33 billion \u2014 Innovu chief executive Ronan Foley expects the pace of expansion to pick up over the coming years. \u201cWe will continue on the acquisition trail and that will be accelerated now,\u201d he said. Naturally, having the financial firepower of an S&P 500-listed company behind it means Innovu will be able to move \u201cmore quickly\u201d on \u201cbigger opportunities\u201d, he said. But while there will be a focus initially on \u201corganic growth\u201d, Foley said the ambition was for Gallagher to be the number one broker in Ireland, and the intention was to \u201cmake that happen over the next few years\u201d. Gallagher\u2019s acquisition could also be seen as a vote of confidence in an Irish market that appeared to be nearing its peak late last year with valuations surging to eye-watering levels. Despite the pace of consolidation in recent years, Foley says there are still opportunities for growth here. The Irish sector has typically been [characterised] \u201cby a large number of brokers in a relatively small market ... that was always gonna be ripe for consolidation at some point\u201d. Compared to the UK market, which is \u201ckind of at the end of that phase\u201d, Ireland continues to be \u201cthe next best opportunity\u201d. If he\u2019s right, more deals are on the way.",

            "raw_text": "London-based insurance group Global Risk Partners (GRP) has completed a deal to acquire the commercial risk and broking business of Willis Towers Watson in Northern Ireland. The move comes amid consolidation in the sector with Innovu also announcing its fourth acquisition locally in the past two years with an agreement to buy Cullen Insurances. GRP, which took a majority stake in Dublin-based Crotty Insurance last September, said its deal creates the largest insurance broker in the North with a combined \u00a3120 million (\u20ac138 million ) portfolio. The acquisition, which was announced in July, sees Willis Towers Watson\u2019s \u00a365 million Northern Irish portfolio becoming part of ABL group. \"We have remained focused on our acquisition strategy throughout the recent challenging and disrupted times. The completion of this excellent deal, transforming ABL into the number one broker in Northern Ireland, is robust evidence of how well that focus has paid off,\" said GRP chief executive Mike Bruce. \u201cIt gives us a great platform to continue to build upon our presence in Northern Ireland, and is a strong signal of our continued drive for growth through M&A across the whole of the UK and Ireland,\u201d he added. Founded in 2013, GRP has written gross premiums in excess of \u00a3800 million and employs more than 1,600 staff. Last year, private equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners acquired a majority stake in GRP. Innovu Separately, Innovu, the private equity-backed insurance brokers group, has acquired Cullen Insurances for an undisclosed sum. The deal is Innovu\u2019s fourth in the past two years after the group previously acquired Goggin Insurances, Sheridan Insurances and Wexford Insurances. MML-backed Innovu said following completion of the deal, the combined business will generate gross written premium of circa \u20ac63 million in 2021. Cullen Insurances was established in 1974 by Bill Cullen. As part of the transaction, managing director, Douglas Howell, and director, Robert Ryan, will become shareholders in the enlarged Innovu Group with Mr Howell also joining the group's board. Innovu said it has several other acquisitions under active consideration as it looks to extend its presence and service offering in the Republic. \"This acquisition represents an important strategic expansion of our presence in Munster and wider Irish market. It will create significant opportunities for our respective clients and staff as we continue to carefully develop our business through strategic-led acquisitions backed by strong organic growth,\" said Ronan Foley, chief executive of Innovu.",

            "raw_text": "Many consumers are at risk of not being fully covered for their losses if they have to make a home insurance claim, the Central Bank has warned. The regulator has identified evidence of increasing levels of under-insurance in the home insurance market following a review. Under-insurance occurs when the sum insured on a property is less than the amount it would cost to rebuild or replace the property. It found under-insurance in the home insurance market has increased from 6.5 per cent in 2017 up to 16.5 per cent in 2021. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 It also found that not all firms were sufficiently highlighting key risks to consumers and said they must take further action. The Central Bank has written to insurance firms outlining the findings. The review was undertaken because consumers are currently facing increasing rebuild costs, which affects the level of insurance cover that a consumer should have on their property. Research  from the society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland published earlier this month found rebuilding costs have jumped by more than a fifth over the past year, meaning homeowners are almost certainly underinsured on their homes, should they be destroyed by fire or otherwise. The Central Bank said that for those who have had their claim reduced due to under-insurance, the average reduction in the claim payment was approximately 19 per cent in 2021, meaning that those customers would have incurred substantial costs to fully meet their costs. There are differences in the way insurance firms present and provide key information to consumers. Firms do remind consumers of the need to review their sum insured, but the regulator said more could be done to highlight the practical consequences. Some firms have proactively identified the risk to consumers, and have taken some steps to help mitigate the risk of under-insurance. However, \u201call firms must take action to effectively mitigate the risk to the consumer\u201d, it said. Central Bank director of consumer protection Colm Kincaid said: \u201cThis review highlights the actions we expect of firms to ensure consumers are properly informed about the risk of under-insurance, and to provide them with relevant and clear information. \u201cThis is especially important at this time of increasing costs, which heightens the risk that consumers could be left without adequate insurance cover. \u201cWe expect all firms to be proactive in identifying emerging risks to consumers and to support their customers in mitigating those risks. This requires firms to have a fully embedded and fit-for-purpose consumer protection risk management framework.\u201d The Central Bank also appealed to consumers to check they have adequate home insurance cover in place when renewing or switching their policy. \u201cWhen reviewing home insurance cover, consumers should not focus on the premium alone but also on the level of buildings and contents cover that is currently in place to ensure it remains appropriate,\u201d it said. \u201cThese details should be reviewed regularly, checking with their insurer or broker as appropriate, to avoid the risk of receiving a reduced payment in the event of a claim. \u201cThe Central Bank also asks that consumers fully consider any communications that insurance firms provide in relation to the risk of under-insurance, especially at this time.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "A lack of available or affordable insurance for thatched properties could result in the loss of traditional thatched buildings across the country, the Oireachtas Committee on Public Petitions has been told. The committee, which hears petitions from members of the public, was told by a number of owners of thatched properties that the problem with insurance had been building for two decades and, despite the fact that many thatched roofs were listed for preservation, no practical help from the Government has emerged. Petitioner Katie McNelis told the committee that her thatched family pub and home in a rural village in Co Tipperary was forced to close because of difficulty in getting insurance for the thatched building. Three generations of her family had been proud to maintain the thatched roof, but after years of instructions from insurers to make changes including the removal of open fires, in April 2021 insurance brokers said they could no longer provide cover as the insurers had left the market. Ms McNelis said cover was not available elsewhere at an affordable price and her mother was then in the position of having \u201ca commercial, thatched listed public house which she then couldn\u2019t open\u201d. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Removing the thatch would be a last resort but possibly \u201cthe only way to get insurance\u201d she said. However, she said, there were difficulties with this approach too as the property remains a listed building and, should anything happen to it, her mother would be obliged by law to return the building to its listed state or face up to two years in jail and/or a fine of up to \u20ac12.7 million, under the Planning and Development Act. Ms McNelis said three generations of her family had been proud to maintain the thatched roof. She said the insurance difficulties had led to the formation of the Thatch Insurance Action Group to drive awareness of the problem. Eoin Darby, a quantity surveyor with additional qualifications in building repair and conservation, said he and his wife commissioned a new thatch roof on a cottage in Malahide in north Co Dublin, which dated from the 1840s. The house had originally been thatched. He said the couple has secured a hard-to-get planning permission and a master thatcher, and thatching was completed in 2002. Unfortunately, in May of 2022, the insurers pulled out of the market. Eventually the couple managed to arrange quotes ranging from \u20ac2,700 to \u20ac6,400 per year. Committee Cathaoirleach Martin Browne said the situation was critical and could have very serious implications for places such as Holycross village in Tipperary where there were a number of thatched houses. He said that unless something was done, thatched homes would remain only \u201con a postcard\u201d. Senator Fintan Warfield agreed with the Cathaoirleach saying a probable outcome was that \u201cthe State will own them, but nobody will live in them\u201d.",

Matt Pawley led NFP into the Republic in 2020 through the purchase of HMP Insurance and Pension Advisors and followed up with three more deals, at a total cost of \u20ac45 million. The business has also got two more purchases in the immediate pipeline, including that of a healthcare benefits firm that is due to close imminently, Mr Pawley said. NFP rebranded HMP about a year ago and said on Tuesday that it is set to change the names of two other acquired firms in the Republic, Aiken Insurances and ReSure Corporate Brokers, by the end of the month. The fourth, financial advisory firm Simon Shirley Advisors, will be rebranded under the NFP banner early next year. Mr Pawley said there continues to be \u201csome good quality\u201d independent Irish brokers out there that have yet to partake in the rapid consolidation that has swept the industry in recent years. However, he added that the pace and value of deals will fall as the cost of debt on global markets continues to rise, as central banks hike official interest rates to rein in inflation. \u201cVolumes and prices will come down a bit. It just has to,\u201d he told The Irish Times. \u201cIt\u2019s simple economics.\u201d The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. NFP is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Investment Partners. While brokers were changing hands about five or six years ago at five to six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda), Pawley said that buyers are now paying multiples \u201cwell into double digits\u201d for \u201cgood-quality brokers in Ireland with any kind of scale and infrastructure\u201d. This year alone has seen the likes of Arachas, one of the most active dealmakers in the industry, which itself was acquired in 2020 by UK brokerage group Ardonagh, buy Glennon Insurances in Dublin, and global insurance giant Arthur J Gallagher announced its arrival in the Irish market with the purchase of Innovu. Elsewhere, PIB Group, a UK intermediary that entered the Irish market in 2017 and went on to buy Campion Insurance in 2021, moved earlier this year to buy Limerick-based Sullivan Insurances. While NFP also has a well-established presence in the UK, Mr Pawley is planning to enter the continental European market in the near term, using the group\u2019s Irish holding company as an acquisition vehicle.",

She says her father \u201chas not owned this car since 2021. I contacted his branch and spoke to the manager, who confirmed he had been continued to be charged for the insurance and they advised me that unfortunately there was no recourse to recoup the insurance paid for 2021 but if I sent a letter to Bank of Ireland Insurance services I could cancel the policy before it renewed in 2021. I organised for a letter to be printed and signed by Anthony and return to Bank of Ireland Insurance Services to organise for the renewal to be cancelled.\u201d Fast forward to more recent times when she found out that rather than cancelling the policy Bank of Ireland simply renewed it.

Claire says she spoke to Bank of Ireland\u2019s vulnerable customer department, which advised her of the forms that needed to be filled in and advised her to make an appointment in branch to get this sorted. \u201cAs I am sure you know, you can no longer ring branches, so you have to fill out a booking request and wait for someone to call back. I tried this about three times and never got a response from anyone in Bank of Ireland to organise that meeting.\u201d When we brought this to the bank\u2019s attention we received this statement: \u201cWe would like to apologise for how this request was mishandled, we fully acknowledge that the policy should have been cancelled when the original request was submitted. We can confirm that it is being addressed as a priority, we have cancelled the policy and contacted the customer\u2019s daughter to arrange a refund. We would like to sincerely apologise for the error.\u201d",

            "title": "Is private health insurance worth getting for the financially squeezed late 20s and 30s?",
            "author": "Brianna Parkins",
            "date": "2024-02-14",
            "raw_text": "Your 30s are meant to be easier. You might have figured out what you want to do with your life, you\u2019ve found a haircut that suits you, you\u2019re on your way up the career ladder and you\u2019re earning more. But this cohort also find themselves squeezed by record-high rents, soaring property prices demanding higher deposits, mortgage repayment hikes if they manage to get on the ladder at all, diminished borrowing power and eye-watering childcare fees. Adding to this is the double-digit percentage increase in private health insurance costs over the past year, meaning the same policy is now costing hundreds extra for many. The largest insurer in the market, VHI, has announced  another price rise  averaging 7 per cent for those renewing or joining in March on top of a 7 per cent increase last October. In addition, some plans have increased their excess and capped amounts on outpatient benefit claims, meaning customers could be paying more out of their own pocket. The other two providers in the Irish market have imposed similar swingeing increases over the past 12 months. So is private health insurance worth getting for people in their financially squeezed late 20s and 30s? There is no one size fits all answer, according to health insurance broker Dermot Goode of  TotalHealthCover.ie  (which is owned by Locktons). It depends on the individual\u2019s financial circumstances and their health but also their risk tolerance in relying on savings instead of insurance. Can you afford not to be insured? \u201cWhen rates start spiralling, that\u2019s when people come to us to ask about the self-pay route,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, for me, the only way that strategy works is if you commit to putting away the same \u20ac1,500-\u20ac2,000 policy cost every year for five-10 years and you never have to dip into it. \u201cIf you put \u20ac1,000 in every year and after five years you have an ACL surgery, that could cost \u20ac5,000 all in or an orthopaedic surgery can be \u20ac5,000-\u20ac8,000 so one small procedure has your fund wiped out.\u201d Goode says the problem with this approach is that people tend to underestimate how expensive a medical problem can be to remedy. Tests, scans and repeat consultant visits could mean patients find themselves liable for thousands of euro \u201cwithout even stepping foot in hospital\u201d \u2013 just to get a diagnosis. For example, a full colonoscopy at the Bon Secours Hospital can set a self-pay patient back \u20ac1,375. But what about the public system? Could you get around these fees and health insurance policies by relying on the public system? In theory, yes though without a medical card, you would still have to pay for GP appointments at the very least. However, it is the state of Ireland\u2019s public health system that is the main push factor for people forking out to join the private system. According to the last consumer survey from Ireland\u2019s insurer watchdog, the  Health Insurance Authority  (HIA), 65 per cent of respondents \u201crefute the idea that health insurance is not needed, and that the public system is adequate\u201d. The most common drivers for people having health insurance, after an employer paying for it, was \u201cinadequate standard of public services\u201d and \u201clack of access to public services/longer waiting lists\u201d. Aside from stories about horror waits in emergency departments, tragic missed diagnoses and trolleys in corridors, Goode says people are concerned \u201cwith the main elephant in the room of the public health system \u2013 the waiting lists\u201d. According to the  HSE , there were 66,745 cases on the outpatient orthopaedics waiting list at the end of 2023. While 20,544 were expected to be on that list for fewer than three months, 11,878 people had an estimated wait time of more than 12 months, and 44 per cent of that number were expected to be waiting more than 1\u00bd years for treatment. Perceptions about the public system might be skewed according to age, with Christina Prendergast of the HIA pointing out that \u201camong the 18-34 year olds, one in five mentions satisfaction with public services as the main reason for not having health insurance\u201d. Aside from access (knowing they can get care quickly), Goode says the other reason people get private health insurance is choice \u2013 knowing they can decide when, where and by who. \u201cWith private cover, you have more choice around when you can go in and what suits you when it comes to family or work,\u201d says Goode. So when deciding whether private health insurance is worth it for you, it is important to examine what commitments you have or plans coming up or a spouse who could take over household duties when needed. For those planning to have children in the future, wanting the same obstetrician throughout the whole process might be one factor influencing your decision to go private or public. Other important influences on the decision lie in the terms and conditions. The big one is Lifetime Community Rating, which financially punishes those who only get private health cover in their elder years when they\u2019re more likely to need more medical help. Those taking out insurance for the first time aged 35 and older will be charged an extra 2 per cent of their policy for every year they spent aged over 34 without health insurance. The maximum loading is 70 per cent \u2013 applying to those taking out private cover at the age of 69 or older. The loading will apply for 10 years, after which you return to the standard policy price. Goode says, for this reason, he commonly sees consumers taking out the minimum level of coverage required before they hit the cut-off age to get around LCR. The other thing to watch out for is when you can actually use your benefits after purchasing your premium. \u201cAnyone buying health insurance for the first time or after a break in cover of more than 13 weeks may have to serve waiting periods before having full access to all of their benefits. The waiting period for inpatient care for pre-existing conditions can be a maximum of five years,\u201d says Prendergast. Goode says he often gets calls from younger people on a Monday after they pick up a suspected sports injury over the weekend seeking private healthcare to cover costs but he says the waiting periods mean \u201cit\u2019s a bit like taking out insurance after you crash the car\u201d. For him, the best time to take out insurance is \u201cwhen you\u2019re healthy\u201d. What about kids? One of the other issues of contention regarding coverage is whether it is worth insuring children. After all, as The Irish Times  explored  last year, they may be covered by school and activity insurance. GP visits for under-eights are free and while private hospitals have paediatric units, specialised children\u2019s hospitals are public. And then there\u2019s the matter of age limits set by private hospital emergency departments. For example, the Mater Network, the Beacon and the Blackrock Clinic do not accept patients under 16 with the last of those three making exceptions at its Galway location for those over the age of five with minor injuries. This is when families need to assess their lifestyles, future needs and budgets to decide if coverage is right for them. For those who can afford it but are on the fence, Goode recommends keeping some things in mind. The first is access to out-of-hours or \u201cfast clinics\u201d offered by private insurers that see minor injuries taken care of without a lengthy hospital wait. \u201cIf it\u2019s something like tonsillitis, I don\u2019t want to be on a waiting list with a child on antibiotics for months longer than necessary; I want to be able to decide who I see and where I go,\u201d Goode says. While private hospitals may not admit children into emergency departments, they often have paediatric departments that take care of planned procedures and consultations. It\u2019s also important to consider assessments for things like neurodevelopmental conditions. Support is often dependent on diagnoses, and wait times for autism and ADHD assessments in the public system are lengthy and they are expensive in the private system if you are paying upfront. To keep the costs down, Goode says kids don\u2019t need to be on the same level of cover as parents. If it suits the family\u2019s needs, they can be insured at a much more basic level. It also pays to check if your insurer has any incentives. For example, a VHI spokesperson says their child rates extend to offspring aged up to 21 if they are studying full-time, with the fourth and more kids free. Laya has reintroduced a Kids Go Free limited time offer from January 2024 on three plans (Essential Connect Family, Essential Health 300 and Flex 125 Explore) where you pay for one kid and the rest go free. You don\u2019t have to stay with the same insurer Lastly, as always, it pays to shop around but it\u2019s especially important when prices are rising and benefits are changing. According to a VHI spokesperson, when it comes to caps on outpatient claims, \u201c15 plans out of a total of 81 plans have been impacted\u201d while \u201c12 plans out of a total of 81 plans with a \u20ac1 day-to-day excess will increase to \u20ac10 excess\u201d. However, the \u201c\u20ac10 excess is an annual excess. It\u2019s payable once per year so doesn\u2019t apply after the first day-to-day claim\u201d. The company says the changes were brought in to \u201caddress some anomalies\u201d and \u201censure fair usage of benefits\u201d while other benefits have been expanded in some cases. Prendergast says VHI aren\u2019t alone and other \u201cinsurers have made benefit changes over the past 12 months, including removing or reducing certain benefits\u201d. \u201cHowever, these changes have not been as widespread as VHI,\u201d she says. While all insurers have put their prices up, Goode calls the change to benefits \u201ca regrettable move we did not want to see or did not expect\u201d. He advises customers caught up in the changes to pick up the phone first before doing anything drastic. Better deals can be had by asking your existing company to find you a similar plan that may be cheaper or by switching to another insurer safe in the knowledge that waiting times on benefits or pre-existing conditions shouldn\u2019t affect your coverage. Ultimately, while it\u2019s up to you whether you think private health insurance is worth it for you and your family, take the time to ask yourself how you feel about the public system, consider your future plans and your health needs, and be sure you have found the best deal before you make the decision.

            "author": "Dominic Coyle",
            "date": "2023-07-09",
            "raw_text": "I was looking at my VHI, and it has frequent questions, one of which is: Can I claim tax relief? VHI answer is: \u201cYes. For people aged 21 and over, including young adults, all health insurance policies and renewals have a maximum of 20 per cent tax relief applied to gross premiums up to \u20ac1,000. This means the maximum tax relief will be \u20ac200.\u201d My question is, can one claim back a maximum of \u20ac200 every year, even if there is no claim? This is something new to me in all my years of paying for VHI. The second question is also in this vein. Let\u2019s say I have a medical receipt for \u20ac100, the VHI claim gives back \u20ac30, can the balance of \u20ac70 be claimed in a tax return? Mr G.N. Private health insurance is not cheap in Ireland so making sure you avail of any tax relief available is important. The good news is that yes, tax relief is available on private health insurance premiums and has been for many years. This relief is not related to whether you have made any claims against the policy; it is granted on the cost of the premium you are paying. It does not just apply to VHI, of course, but to any policy taken out with any of the insurers in the private health cover market. And, on this score, you are in luck. The standard rule with tax relief claims is that you can go back four years before the current tax year, and no further. In your case, this would have left you significantly out of pocket if you had not claimed the relief available on your private health policy. But, with private health premiums, the relief is granted at source. That means it is subtracted from your premium by the VHI before it charges you anything, so you have not been missing out on the relief available over the past several decades. Of course, on the downside, this means there is no money due to you on having now discovered the availability of tax relief. I guess it might be easy to miss in the mound of paperwork that generally arrives with your health policy renewal. My most recent one had 13 pages of paperwork \u2013 which can be overwhelming for many people. In the case of VHI, the page you want to refer to is the second page in the documents they send you, headlined, \u201cYour health membership certificate\u201d. If you look down that page, you will come across the section on your premium details. It will have nine or 10 sections running across the page. These include your name, the gross premium, an RE [risk equalisation] premium credit, any discount pertaining to the policy, a figure for the gross premium after those credits and discounts, any age loading and then the gross premium net of all those reductions. This is the key \u201cgross premium\u201d figure. The next section states \u201ctax relief at source\u201d and, given the price of private health policies these days, this is likely to be \u20ac200. The final box has your net premium, which is what you are paying over the following 12 months. Details will be presented in broadly the same way for the other insurers, I am guessing. The maximum relief is 20 per cent up to a premium of \u20ac1,000 for an adult and 20 per cent of a premium of up to \u20ac500 for a child. So if your premium is below \u20ac1,000, you get 20 per cent of that; if it is above \u20ac1,000, the relief is capped at that \u20ac200. For a child similarly, the cap is \u20ac100 on any premium of \u20ac500 or over. Interestingly, the definition of a child has changed over the years but now covers insured people under the age of 21, not 18. Until 2015, it could cover people up to the age of 23 if they were in full-time education. The relief used to be more generous \u2013 20 per cent of the actual premium paid \u2013 but that was reduced in the Finance (No 2) Act 2013. There was a row at the time as it emerged that 1.1 million people would lose out under the new rules. [\u00a0 Are you getting the most out of your health insurance? Many of us fail to claim these benefits \u00a0] So that\u2019s the health premium. But what about medical costs that are not covered by the policy? Taking your example, if you have a medical receipt for \u20ac100 and the VHI agrees to cover \u20ac30 of that, you are out of pocket personally for the balance of \u20ac70. The good news is that you are allowed to claim against your income tax for any medical costs that are not otherwise covered by your private health insurance \u2013 for those that have it \u2013 or by other schemes such as the Drug Payment Scheme, which currently limits the amount you can be charged for prescription medicines to \u20ac80 in any one month. Everything, including GP fees, can be claimed back. The relief is granted at 20 per cent of the sum claimed \u2013 unless you are claiming for long-term nursing home care which is granted at a person\u2019s higher rate of up to 40 per cent \u2013 so it won\u2019t make you rich but better in your pocket than in Revenue\u2019s. To be fair, Revenue regularly reminds people they should be claiming such reliefs, and it is an area we cover annually or more frequently as they issue such reminders. Health expenses are apparently the relief to which people are entitled that they claim the least, so you are not alone. You used to file for relief under what was called a Med 1 form (a Med 2 form covered more restricted reliefs for dental costs) but now you claim relief on a basic tax return form. Many PAYE people are not familiar with these but they are fairly straightforward and are now required where you either have income outside the PAYE sector \u2013 such as perhaps rental income from a holiday home \u2013 or where you are claiming additional tax reliefs. Most people now make their filings online to Revenue having set up a MyAccount account. For those unable to file online for any reason, you can file a Form 12 income tax return or, more likely in your case, a simplified Form12S shortened form for those making a claim for something basic such as health costs. The bad news is that you will only be able to claim back medical costs over the last four years \u2013 the four years prior to the current tax year \u2013 so, since the start of 2019 as long as you make the claim before the end of this year. And you will need to hold on to any receipts that you are claiming against. You don\u2019t have to send these to Revenue but they have the right to seek them over the next few years if they choose to. On dental costs, unless medical where GP costs are covered, routine visits, dental cleaning and fillings are not covered, though things like crowns will be. Of course, you might find that you are entitled to free dental check-ups under your PRSI record, so don\u2019t forget to check that out. Your dentist\u2019s surgery can do that for you if you ask.

            "raw_text": "Publican Jim Gordon is \u201cthrilled, absolutely thrilled\u201d with Friday\u2019s High Court ruling against insurer FBD over coronavirus closures. FBD said on Friday it will make interim payments to \u201cvalid\u201d business interruption claims under its pubs policy, after four publicans won a landmark court case against the insurer. \u201cIt\u2019s a happy day. I\u2019m delighted to see the insurance companies pinned to the wall, they\u2019ve had us pinned to the wall for so long,\u201d Mr Gordon said. His bar, Oskars, on the outskirts of Waterford city, is one of about 1,000 establishments affected by the judgment. But his relief on Friday morning was tempered with the worry that \u201cthis payout could take years. Companies could go to the wall in the meantime\u201d. The other fear, he added, is that \u201cwe will pay for it down the road\u201d with higher premiums or that the ruling might drive insurers out of the Irish market. Policy When the country went into lockdown in March, Mr Gordon contacted FBD, with whom he had a policy costing \u20ac14,000 a year. The policy included the so-called \u201c25 mile\u201d clause which proved crucial to the case, stating that a business is covered if the closure is caused by nationwide outbreaks of disease, where there is an outbreak within the 25-mile radius. However, FBD replied that he was not covered. \u201cI was advised by the Vintners\u2019 Federation of Ireland to write a letter to my broker and my insurance company, stating that I want to make a claim against this policy for loss of earnings, because I\u2019ve been closed by the Government due to a disease in my area.\u201d FBD responded again to say it did not believe the business was covered, but it would keep his case on file. He has heard nothing since, but kept a close eye on the case taken by four publicans in the meantime. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been frustrated by how long it took.\u201d While they wait for the insurance payout to come through, \u201cwe still have overhead costs \u2013 phone lines, electricity, broadband and mortgages. So the loss of earnings has been substantial. Unless we open, and open quite soon, there are a lot of businesses going to go to the wall.\u201d Government supports mean \u201cwe\u2019re getting 10 per cent of our net turnover repaid. But that doesn\u2019t cover all my bills\u201d. He is hopeful, however, that the judgment will have knock-on implications for similar policies held with other insurers. Last week, the UK-based company which insures a second pub he owns, Revolution Bar in Waterford city, made contact to ask him to provide evidence of lost earnings.",

            "raw_text": "This is not a great year to be in the business of insuring satellites and rockets. In recent months, the California-based  Viasat  has announced malfunctions in two of its most eagerly anticipated satellites: Viasat-3, which was to provide services to the Americas; and Inmarsat-6 F2, part of a fleet billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s most technologically advanced commercial communications satellites ever launched\u201d. Then last week,  Rocket Lab\u2019 s two-year record of flawless launches ended with the failure of its Electron rocket and the loss of the satellite it was carrying. Rates doubled When all the mishaps are added up, claims could total roughly $1 billion (\u20ac948 million) this year, say industry sources, against premium income of roughly $600 million. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Not since 2019 has the space insurance sector had such a bad year. Then, insurance rates doubled almost overnight. This time round that could be the best case. \u201cI think the situation in terms of losses vs premiums will be worse this year than 2019,\u201d says Denis Bensoussan, head of space at Beazley insurers. \u201cYou can expect a larger and longer correction from the insurance market.\u201d The scale of that correction was a hot topic at the recent World Business Satellite Week in Paris. Many in the industry speculated about a contraction of underwriting capacity. Already several insurance providers have quit the market. \u201cThere are a lot of people concerned about their position now,\u201d one veteran space insurance broker told me. Another added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good on their five year average.\u201d Adding to insurers\u2019 concerns is the complexity of business models in the most commercially dynamic region of space, low earth orbit; growing congestion in certain orbits; and a lack of international rules to govern this new use of space. Are the EU and China edging towards a trade war? Space market research firm Euroconsult estimates that some 26,100 small satellites will be launched over the next decade \u2014 almost four times as many as the previous one. Most will be part of broadband mega-constellations in low earth orbit, such as Elon Musk\u2019s  Starlink  or the UK\u2019s OneWeb. The risk of a disastrous cascade of collisions is a growing concern as low earth orbit gets more populated. Yet many of the companies operating there are not insured. According to Axa XL, of the 4,400 operational low earth orbit satellites in 2021, just 47 were covered. Given that most low-earth orbit satellites are smaller, cheaper and usually part of a constellation with hundreds or thousands of spacecraft, the failure of one or two is not an issue. \u201cThey often buy less or no insurance because they have inherent redundant capacity in orbit,\u201d said Adam Sturmer of space brokers Marsh. Stephane Germain, president of methane tracking start-up GHGSat, said: \u201cFor the relatively small cost of these sats, putting a large insurance burden on small satellite operators would probably kill the mission in the first place.\u201d If there is a reluctance to insure assets in low earth orbit, operators cannot ignore the requirement in many countries for third-party liability cover. In the UK, operator liabilities are capped at \u20ac60 million per satellite, with anything more covered by the state as provided for under international law. Prohibitive cost Yet this cap is under review in the UK and other countries are also considering their approach. The current cap made sense when commercial space meant constellations of two or three satellites 35,000km above the earth in geostationary orbit. It does not make sense for mega-constellations in regions closer to Earth. The cost would be prohibitive. Earlier this month the UK proposed varying liability requirements according to the mission. The UK hopes such a framework could be the basis for internationally shared regulatory standards. This is not only badly needed to help reduce the risk of devastating accidents. It could also help to reassure a volatile space insurance market. Widely shared regulatory standards could be a valuable tool for assessing risk, allowing insurers to reward the most sustainable projects with lower premiums. Even if low-earth orbit operators do not yet see an urgent need for cover on orbit, the space sector needs a stable and viable insurance market. Over the next decade, Euroconsult estimates the small-satellite industry will accumulate about $110 billion in market value. As the industry matures, and customers come to rely on its services, the day may come when the risks of disruption are too great even for the likes of Starlink. \u2014 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023",

The price hike \u2013 which the company said would add an average of \u20ac42 to the annual cost of policies \u2013 comes just weeks after it said it had no plans to increase prices this year. The price increase was blamed on the soaring volume and cost of claims as well as higher energy and staffing costs. While the average price increase was put at 3 per cent, the cost of some policies will climb by 5 per cent with the financial impact on affected customers substantially more than the \u20ac42 highlighted by the company.

The price increase comes just days after it was announced that French insurance giant Axa has agreed to buy the health insurance company from a unit of US rival AIG, in a deal worth \u20ac650 million. Laya has about a 28 per cent share of the Irish health insurance market, serving 690,000 members and generating about \u20ac800 million in premiums annually. The company is a tied agent that sells health and life products underwritten by units of Swiss Re. \u201cWe are sensitive to the financial pressures our members are facing, and we\u2019ve tried to minimise the impact of a premium increase on them,\u201d said Laya\u2019s managing director D\u00f3nal Clancy. \u201cHowever, we need to ensure that we\u2019re serving the current and future healthcare needs of our members, striking a balance of keeping premiums affordable while meeting the growing needs of our 690,000 members and giving them rapid access to more hospitals, consultants and urgent care services when they need it.\u201d He said that claim costs were a significant factor of health insurance premiums with Laya \u201cseeing a sustained increase in the cost and frequency of medical claims, notably in the private and high-tech hospitals\u201d. He said that in the year to date there had been a 24 per cent increase in the volume of claims, while the overall cost of claims has increased by 18 per cent \u2013 the highest rate of claims increases that we\u2019ve seen in over a decade.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "The average cost of health insurance has fallen by 3 per cent in the last quarter. The price decline came as the Vhi Healthcare, Laya and Irish Life Health passed on reductions in stamp duty following lower-than-anticipated payouts in recent months . The average price reductions have been outlined in one of two reports from the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) that also found while prices are falling across the board, people over the age of 65 continue to pay over 30 per cent more for cover than younger cohorts. According to a quarterly report lookng at the state of the market, just over 17,000 people took out a new health insurance policy over the last three months, an increase that takes the numbers with cover to 2.4 million. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Although the number of adults insured has increased by 3 per cent in the last 12 months, the percentage of children insured has been declining since 2019. The HIA\u2019s annual report found that over the last year, insurers \u201ccontinued to be proactive in adjusting individual product benefits and prices and added new services and features so that the complexity of the market for consumers remained high\u201d. The addition of new features will be welcomed by consumers, but the complexity makes it harder for people to assess which policies offer the best value for money leading to many people paying over the odds, something which disproportionately impacts older people. HIA chairwoman Patricia Byron hailed \u201ca strong demand for health insurance in 2021\u2033 and noted the \u201ctrend is continuing as we can see from our latest trend report, despite rises in the cost of living, people still place a high importance on their health insurance cover\u201d. However, she expressed concern that despite the existence of a community rating that means age is not permitted by law to impact health insurance premiums, the over-65s pay, on average, 34 per cent more than younger groups. \u201cWhere consumers are facing into a winter of cost-of-living increases, we\u2019d urge consumers to avail of the HIA\u2019s consumer support services when considering health renewal premiums,\u201d she said. According to the report, the premium income earned by the insurers amounts to \u20ac2.9 billion per annum with Laya being the only insurer to continue to increase their market share. It currently stands at 27.5 per cent while Vhi and Irish Life retain their share of the market at 48.5 per cent and 20.5 per cent respectively. \u201cIn October 2021 we identified a surplus in the [risk equalisation] scheme and recommended a reduction in the stamp duty charged to insurers that would apply from April 1st,\u201d HIA chief executive Laura Brien said. She welcomed the passing of cost savings to consumers by insurers through lower premium prices. Risk equalisation involves transfer payments between health insurers to spread some of the claims cost of the high-risk older and less healthy members among all the private health insurers in the market in proportion to their market share.",

            "raw_text": "Kerry-based Gallivan Murphy Insurance Brokers (GMIB) has agreed to be bought by a private equity-backed US insurance broking group, called Assured Partners, in a deal believed to be worth more than \u20ac100 million, as consolidation across the industry continues apace. The Killarney-based firm, which will continue to be led by joint managing directors and co-owners Simon Gallivan and Denis Murphy after the deal goes through, has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years as a result of its investment in its online offering and currently writes about \u20ac60 million worth of personal and commercial lines of insurance. GMIB\u2019s chairman and third owner, Tadgh Gallivan, will remain a non-executive director of GMIB and be \u201cinvolved in identifying further opportunities for expansion in the Irish market place\u201d, the companies said in a statement. GMIB, which was founded in 1989, expects its workforce to grow from a current 85 to 250 over the next three to five years, according to the statement. It is generating about \u20ac15 million in annual revenues, the equivalent of 25 per cent of gross written premiums. \u201cGiven the scale and resources of Assured Partners, this is a very positive development for existing and new clients of GMIB who will continue to receive excellent customer service and competitive insurance premiums,\u201d said Mr Murphy. Flurry of deals The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past five years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms. Assured Partners is controlled by GTCR, a Chicago-based private equity company. The attraction for financial investors lies in the fact that insurance broking is a fee-based business that delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle, and strong cash flows that allow buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. The most active dealmaker in recent times has been Arachas, whose name is Irish for insurance. Arachas itself was acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a private equity-backed UK brokerage group. UK-based insurance intermediary PIB Group, also controlled by private equity firms, moved last year to buy three Irish brokerages, including Wexford-based Campion Insurance. Mop up Elsewhere, private-equity firm MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland has dived into the broker space in recent years using a vehicle called Innovu to mop up a series of businesses. Assured Partners, founded just over a decade ago, is one of the fastest growing, independent insurance agencies in the US, Britain, Ireland and Europe, with a total of 8,500 employees. \u201cThis latest addition to the group marks another important step in its growth strategy by establishing a presence and acquiring a scalable growth platform in the Irish marketplace,\u201d it said. It follows recent deals in Scotland and several across England.",

            "raw_text": "Trying to pin down Conor Brennan, chief executive of Arachas Corporate Brokers, the largest nationwide insurance broker in Ireland, for a face-to-face interview in recent times has been tricky. The Dubliner has found himself somewhere on the Continent scouting for deals two days a week since November, double-jobbing as the head of the new European division of the company's parent of 31 months, Ardonagh, the UK brokerage group. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant hassle in that the night before I travel involves a PCR test,\u201d he says as he finally gets to sit down with me this week. \u201cYou have to be constantly aware that some countries have stricter [Covid restrictions] than others. It\u2019s just incredible how much things vary two years into this. I was in Amsterdam a few weeks ago and it was completely locked down. Anyone I was speaking to was mortally fearful.\u201d Ardonagh, named after a low hill near its chief executive David Ross\u2019s native Mullingar, bought Arachas, itself one of the most acquisitive brokers in the Republic for almost two decades, in 2020 for an eye-watering \u20ac250 million. Part of Brennan's pitch when Arachas's then owners, UK private equity firm Sovereign Capital Partners, put the business on the block in 2019 was that it could become a launch pad for a buyer to expand into continental Europe post-Brexit. Ardonagh has run with that idea, putting Brennan in charge of finding European targets \u2013 with a \u20ac1 billion war chest. The growth strategy outside of Britain and Ireland was also key to Ardonagh completing a $1 billion (\u20ac890 million) fundraise before Christmas, which saw the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invest alongside existing shareholders, US private equity houses Madison Dearborn and HPS Investment Partners. The transaction valued Ardonagh \u2013 which Ross formed seven years ago by merging the then-faltering London broker Towergate with a group of five others \u2013 at $7.5 billion. \"If things go according to plan, 70 per cent of the next phase of growth will come from international expansion; in Europe and in our [new] Ardonagh Global Partners unit, which will account for everything outside Europe,\" says Brennan. \"It will be literally like building an Ardonagh all over again.\" It\u2019s been quite the journey for a man who, when first asked by an insurance executive in 2007 if he\u2019d ever thought about getting into the industry, uttered the line: \u201cI can safely say I\u2019ll never consider working in insurance.\u201d The Clontarf native (54), who still lives in the north Dublin coastal suburb, completed a communications degree in the mid-1980s in the then National Institute for Higher Education (now Dublin City University). \"This was in the pre-internet era of two-TV-stations Ireland. The guys in the engineering faculty used to laugh at us, saying we'd never get a job.\" To find gainful employment, Brennan moved to the UK in 1989 to work in the commercial department of Haymarket, the publishing house co-founded by Michael Heseltine, the former Tory grandee who played a key role in Margaret Thatcher's fall from power. He returned to Ireland in 1992 to take on a commercial role with the Sunday Business Post and went on to join Chambers Ireland, the State\u2019s largest business network, in 2004 as deputy chief executive. Opportunity dangled While Brennan initially poo-pooed the notion of getting into insurance, when an opportunity was dangled before him in 2007 by an executive at Eagle Star in Ireland \u2013 which was in the process of rebranding under its Swiss parent Zurich Insurance's name \u2013 he found himself in the role as director of the company's broker distribution operation early the following year. His six years in the position coincided with one of the most tumultuous periods for general insurance in the Republic: the Quinn Insurance collapse into administration and RSA Insurance Ireland receiving a \u20ac400 million-plus bailout from its UK parent after a massive hole was discovered in its balance sheet. \u201c[Zurich group executives] just couldn\u2019t get their heads around the instability of a market that they had seen as being a quite small and mature one in a well-developed economy \u2013 and a responsible one, at that, as was clear from how we responded to the financial crisis,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe question I used to get asked was: is our capital safe? But they remained very supportive of the management team.\u201d While the insurance market is cyclical, the Irish market has been a \u201croller-coaster\u201d ride \u2013 for insurers and customers alike \u2013 in the past decade and a half. Not that being away during the working week didn't have its benefits. He managed to get to see a play in the West End most weeks and head out on occasion to see an evening football match Brennan went on to spend a six-month stint in the first half of 2014 as chief administrative officer of Zurich's Dublin-based Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) business under then chief executive Patrick Manley, mainly working on trying to sort out challenged units at the time, such as its Russian retail business (which it ended up selling). He then served for two years as chief executive of the Zurich general insurance business in Ireland, \u201cremediating\u201d parts of the business, as he puts it, at a time when the industry as a whole was lossmaking and hiking motor premiums. \u201cWe got the business to a good state in 2016 and then, out of the blue, came an offer to head up Zurich\u2019s UK general insurance business. I got the call on a Wednesday and I was in London the following Monday. I was told that the skillset I has shown in Ireland was then appropriate for the UK business.\u201d \u2018Fixer\u2019 What skillset was that? \u201cFixer,\u201d he says. Brennan says his wife, Claire, and their three sons made it clear they weren\u2019t upping sticks, which led to a period of him taking red-eye Monday morning flights to London City Airport and return trips on Fridays. \u201cThe penny dropped [that this was unsustainable] when I was into my second year commuting and I\u2019d gotten to know people who had been doing this for 15 years or so. And, from talking to them, I learned that the biggest regrets many had were missing out on family life and occasions. At that stage, I knew there was a limit to how long I could do this.\u201d Not that being away during the working week didn't have its benefits. He managed to get to see a play in the West End most weeks and head out on occasion to see an evening football match (Crystal Palace's stadium Selhurst Park was his favourite ground in London). But by early 2018, he\u2019d had enough. While Brennan says he returned to the Republic in April 2018 without a job, he was already having \"conversations\". One was with Donal Cronin, an old friend and chief executive of Arachas. Cronin had led Arachas\u2019s formation through the merger in 2004 of Tyrrell Coakley (the Cork broker he had bought with two friends seven years earlier from his father-in-law) with Dublin rivals Hodgins Percival and Slattery Jermyn. At the time the two started chatting in early 2018, Cronin was on the acquisitions trail, bankrolled by Sovereign, which had taken a majority stake in the business a year earlier. Cronin, who remained a 23 per cent shareholder, was planning to step back and he and Sovereign were looking for a new chief executive who understood how to scale a business quickly. Brennan had the job by that June. Following a series of purchases under Sovereign, including Kidd Insurances, Capital Cover Group, Clover Centre Insurance and Murray & Spelman (whose chairman, former minister for finance Charlie McCreevy, would ultimately take on the same role at Arachas), the UK private equity firm put the business on the block in 2019. Prepared to commit Brennan and his team were clear that the new owner needed to be prepared to commit \u201clong-term capital\u201d to allow the business to invest and grow. It came close to doing a deal with a US company, which he declines to identify. But things didn\u2019t feel right: \u201cI felt there was a very strong chance of us being managed from the US.\u201d Ardonagh was probably third in the pecking order at the time. \"But they sniffed an opportunity and David Ross and Aurelio Cusaro HPS executive\u20ac250 million \u2013 representing a chunky valuation of some 14.5-times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past five years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms. The attraction is obvious: insurance broking is a fee-based business that delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle, and strong cash flows that allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. At the time of the Ardonagh purchase in mid-2020, Arachas had set its sights of doubling within five years the \u20ac270 million of annual gross premiums it was writing for everything from plumbers to sporting organisations. It's already well ahead of plan and currently writing about \u20ac450 million of business, albeit fuelled by the purchase last October of Waterford-based Hooper Dolan. I think the recent reforms around court awards, perjury legislation and a lot of other good things the Government is doing to try and bring down insurance costs will take time to filter through The underlying business has been growing at an organic rate of about 10 per cent a year in recent times, according to Brennan. Arachas reckons that most of the big possible deals in the Irish industry have now been done, though there may be some opportunities among smaller brokers around the State. Brennan's main acquisitions focus is now on more fragmented markets in Europe, where he led Ardonagh's move six weeks ago to buy Portugal-based broker, MDS Group, which manages more than \u20ac500 million of premiums for clients across Portugal, Brazil, Spain, and some other markets. Brennan has also been doing his homework on the German, Belgian, Dutch, Polish, Spanish and Italian markets. Where does he see the next purchase? \"Spain and Germany are interesting\" is as far as he will go. \u2018Inflection point\u2019 Meanwhile, he believes the Irish general insurance market is at an \u201cinflection point\u201d after years of turmoil in the motor, and public and private liability markets. The Personal Injury Assessment Board (PIAB) reported in October that the value of awards assessed by it dropped by an average of 40 per cent in the first five-month period after new judicial payout guidelines were introduced in April. However, executives at insurers including FBD, RSA Ireland and AIG Ireland told the Oireachtas finance committee in December that they had only lowered motor rates by 5-10 per cent last year, as the rejection rate of PIAB awards had spiked. \u201cI think the recent reforms around court awards, perjury legislation and a lot of other good things the Government is doing to try and bring down insurance costs will take time to filter through,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has been an expectation that once legislation is in, prices need to drop immediately.\u201d Actuaries can only assess the cost of risk by looking at sustained patterns, he says. \u201cIf something was costing \u20ac20,000 from an awards prospective and is expected to fall to \u20ac4,000 as a result of new legislation or guidelines, actuaries need to see six months of hundreds of claims at the lower level going through before they believe it. They will say: \u2018Unless I can see that pattern, I cannot reflect that in my pricing, because if I get it wrong from a pricing perspective, then I will lose capital for my business. \u201cOf course, when you explain this to people, they say, \u2018Jeeze, another excuse from insurance companies\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not speaking on behalf of insurance companies, but I think it has to stop being so adversarial. I think insurers need to come to the table. But they need to feel that if they come to the table, they are going to have a reasonable discussion with public representatives, whether they are in opposition or in government.\u201d One indigenous insurer Brennan says the \u201cnoise\u201d in political and public discourse makes it difficult for brokers to bring in insurance coverage from overseas. The State only has one indigenous insurer, FBD. \u201cI\u2019m out there trying to get capacity. I know how difficult that noise makes our job,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves. Insurers are here to make a return on capital. They invest \u20ac100 if they believe they can get back \u20ac112. That\u2019s the model. \u201cWe can\u2019t be surprised when we see headlines about a lack of capacity in parts of the market when the message capacity [insurers] is getting is that you\u2019re not really welcome here and you\u2019re not allowed to get a return on capital.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "People with multi-trip annual travel insurance policies which are due to expire in the weeks ahead will retain cover for Covid-19 related cancellations once they are renewed and not allowed lapse, an industry expert has confirmed. Policies taken out last summer have significantly different terms and conditions to those issued since March when Covid-19 related cover was largely removed. However, once a customer renews an existing policy rather than either letting it lapse or switching to an alternate provider, they should still have some protection for holidays due to be taken in the months ahead as long as bookings were made before the crisis hit. \"If you booked that summer holiday for July, August or later in the year, then let your policy automatically renew or renew it yourself, but don't let it lapse,\" the managing director of Blue Insurance Ciaran Mulligan told The Irish Times. \u201cBy renewing an annual policy, customers ensure they have a continuation of cover for any holidays that would have been booked prior to Covid-19 becoming a pandemic,\u201d he continued. He said that when policies were being renewed with any company people should make sure there was cover for Travel Disruption or Government Travel Advice although he warned that anyone who takes out a new policy will most likely not be covered for any Covid-19 related cancellations. \u201cAnother reason to consider renewing your policy is that there is a potential for insurance prices to increase, possibly coming this summer, as a result of the number of potential claims,\u201d he said. He added that prices could increase by as much at 25 per cent if a high volume of claims are settled by insurers this summer. Meanwhile, the Vhi has confirmed it will offer cover to customers renewing multi-trip travel insurance policies for trip cancellation due to Covid-19 for trips in 2020 provided the trips were booked prior to March 19th, 2020. On that date, the company added a general exclusion to its terms and conditions for any claims caused by or relating to Coronavirus (Covid-19) or any mutation of the disease. \u201cThis was necessary at the time given the general uncertainty around travel but did cause some difficulties for our customers,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cVhi have now established a fund to further support our Vhi MultiTrip customers during this period.\u201d As the peak of the travel season comes closer the company said it was seeing increasing volumes of cancellation claims for pre-booked trips. \u201cThis cover is provided in the Vhi multi-trip base policy with no need for customers to purchase an add-on. Vhi multi-trip cover needs to be in place at the time of planned trip in order to claim, therefore it is important that cover remains in place.\u201d She said emergency medical cover abroad would not be subject to the Covid-19 exclusion provided customers were not travelling against advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs which currently rules out overseas travel.",

Fine Gael TD Colm Brophy said at the Covid-19 Oireachtas committee meeting, if the State retains Irish hospitals under public control for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic \"there is no logic in paying private health insurance\". \u201cIndeed there is even a questionable logic in continuing to pay this year\u2019s private insurance,\u201d he added. Mr Brophy asked secretary general of the Department of Health Jim Breslin: \"Can you reassure people that you're not actually envisaging a situation which effectively amounts to the abolition of private insurance?\" Mr Breslin replied: \u201cNo and the health insurers have given a rebate.\u201d He insisted however that \u201cit is by agreement\u201d and he said \u201cI would not reduce it to an either-or option\u201d. Speaking at the committee which is investigating the State\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Breslin said \u201cI think there will likely be different options that you could look as we now see where we are and what the fugture might hold. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply do you do the deal that you did the last time, do you continue with that or do you not do the deal.\u201d Arrangement The secretary general pointed out that the arrangement between the Department of Health and the 19 private hospitals \u201cis in place for three months and the HSE has the option to expand that for a fourth month and by agreement with the private hospitals for a fifth month.\u201d \u201cWe are now coming up to the end of month two when we will do a review to decide what we will do after month three.\u201d Earlier Mr Breslin had told committee members that the requirement for the use of private hospital facilities would continue because there could be a further surge. \"We're not a health system endowed with capacity\", he told Fianna F\u00e1il health spokesman Stephen Donnelly. Mr Breslin said earlier that they would have to review the use of private facilities. He said a majority of consultants had signed up for the public system and that private patients would be offered the choice of whether they wished to stay with their private consultant or transfer over to the public system. Mr Brophy said that based on this \"effectively there is no private care in Ireland and for most people than means an end to private insurance\". \u201cAm I correct in understanding that for somebody entering with a new complaint there is no such position\u201d as private insurance. Mr Breslin said it was not an either or option but it would be reviewed at the end of the month.",

            "raw_text": "Sinn F\u00e9in deputy D\u00e1il leader Pearse Doherty called on the Taoiseach and the Government to \"stop swallowing the guff and spin\" of the insurance industry, during heated exchanges over the costs of premiums and profits for the sector. Leo Varadkar rejected the claims and insisted that \"I have never been soft on the insurance industry, not in the slightest\". Mr Varadkar stressed that motor insurance premiums had come down by about 20 per cent since they peaked in 2016 after Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin pointed to the findings of the report of that National Claims Information database that insurance costs has risen by 62 per cent over the past five years. Mr Martin said the Government had failed young people in particular over the huge increase in insurance costs, when profits for the sector were so high. But Mr Doherty hit out at the Government and Fianna F\u00e1il and said they did not need a report to know that premiums had risen so much. After the Taoiseach suggested Mr Doherty was accusing him of lying the Donegal TD said \u201cI am accusing the industry of spinning and lying\u201d and the two largest parties of \u201cswallowing their guff\u201d. The Sinn F\u00e9in finance spokesman, who has repeatedly raised the high cost of insurance in the D\u00e1il, said motor premiums had increased each year since 2016 even though the number of claims had dropped by 40 per cent. He highlighted the difficulties for parents because of the crisis in insurance coverage for creches and the withdrawal of an insurer from the sector. Mr Doherty said there was now only one insurer in place and many parents did not know if creches would reopen in the new year. He repeatedly claimed that the Government had failed to act on insurance and had \u201cmidsiagnosed\u201d the problems in the childcare sector which he described as \u201ccompletely unregulated\u201d. Mr Doherty called for a Cabinet sub-committee to be immediately established to deal with the crisis in childcare insurance coverage. He said it was a disjointed sector and \u201cseriously dysfunctional\u201d in the way it is operated because it is overseen by several departments. Mr Doherty said he understood that it could be \u201chundreds\u201d of creches that had not re-registered. He said there was a serious crisis and he said parents expected Government to intervene where there is \u201cserious failure\u201d. Will creches close in the new year? The Taoiseach acknowledged that there were a lot of worried parents, concerned that childcare facilities may close or that they might face significant increases in charge. But he said that the Department of Children was engaged with the issue to ensure that \u201cwe don\u2019t see creches closing in the new year\u201d. He would be meeting Minister for Children Katherine Zappone on Tuesday night to discuss the issue, which had arisen in the past 11 days. He said a Cabinet sub-committee would not resolve insurance issues but Government action would and \u201cthat action is taking place\u201d and the Government had introduced major reforms which were having an effect. He added that the Judicial Council, the committee of judges who will review the level of awards in insurance claims, the book of quantum, had formally been established on Tuesday. The Taoiseach added that one of the difficulties with insurance costs had been the lack of transparency and the report of the national claims information database, from the Central Bank, had only happened because of Government action to provide clear data.",

            "raw_text": "After a couple of years when the pandemic clipped our wings, we are all probably a bit rusty when it comes to being travel ready. Booking the plane tickets and choosing the hotel is the easy bit, but what about travel insurance, foreign exchange, and Covid certs? Sarah Slattery, aka  The Travel Expert , has more than 30 years\u2019 experience in the travel industry. Her website offers destination advice, travel tips and travel deals to Irish consumers. She agrees that people are keen to take to the skies again but many of us are somewhat out of practice when it comes to travelling after a prolonged sojourn at home. \u201cI think that may have been the case last summer, especially at the airport security queue \u2013 the 100ml rule was forgotten about by many,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut to be fair, many new rules and entry requirements were introduced during the pandemic, so it was understandable that we forgot the basics.\u201d The good news is that Covid-19 restrictions no longer apply for travel within the EU, but Slattery warns there are some countries with restrictions still in place \u2013 for example, you still need to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter the US. \u201cMake sure to check the  Department of Foreign Affairs website  for up-to-date requirements, as requirements can change,\u201d she says. Insurance ideas Some families may have opted to avoid travel chaos in 2022 but are gearing up for their first big trip this year. Slattery advises that travellers are adequately insured \u2013 choosing additional winter sports cover for a skiing trip, for example. She also emphasises the importance of checking terms and conditions of each policy, particularly when it comes to Covid and cancellation \u2013 it hasn\u2019t gone away you know. \u201cIf your trip is expensive, you will need the highest level of cover for cancellation,\u201d she says. \u201cMany book basic travel insurance, which covers cancellation up to \u20ac1,000. However, for long haul travel, the cost will more than likely be a lot higher than that.\u201d Her golden rule is to book insurance when booking the holiday; \u201cdon\u2019t leave it until the last minute\u201d. Cash concerns The advent of contactless payment means there is no longer any need to travel with wads of cash, but it can be an expensive way to spend abroad, with additional charges on every transaction, even the smallest ones. Similarly, cash withdrawals abroad can often result in multiple fees, making a dent in your spending money. There are cheaper ways to buy an ice cream, says Michael Hall, product marketing lead for Travel Money at An Post Money, which offers both cash and card travel money services. Indeed, for those going beyond the euro zone, money experts advise travelling with a specific overseas card, where all foreign currency transactions are commission free. The An Post Money Currency Card lets customers top up 15 different currencies, including Australian dollars, British pounds, US dollars and Mexican pesos. Hall says it\u2019s easy to use and very flexible. \u201cYou can manage your money the way you want to \u2013 you can top-up in all currencies in post offices, online or through the app, with the rate applied at the point of top-up,\u201d he says, adding that the card is accepted anywhere Mastercard is accepted. An additional tip is to always pay in the local currency. These cards come with the added benefit of security features \u2013 a duplicate card is given in case one gets lost or stolen, while emergency cash up to the amount loaded on your card can be accessed in case both go AWOL. \u201cThere is 24/7 global support, and the card can also be frozen via the app so that funds are safe,\u201d adds Hall. The currency cards are available at any post office, or through the An Post Money app, available on the App Store and Google Play. For those who prefer to deal in cash, An Post offers five currencies through its network of more than 900 post offices. British pounds and US dollars are available in every office, while Polish zloty, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars are available in selected offices. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to pre-order or prepay, and all currencies are offered commission-free,\u201d Hall says.",

            "author": "Mark Paul",
            "date": "2024-03-06",
            "raw_text": "Britain\u2019s  Conservative Party  has switched into pre-election mode with a spring budget sweetened with a cut in national insurance and the promise of more tax cuts to come. The party also stole one of the opposition Labour Party\u2019s flagship fiscal policies by abolishing a system of tax breaks for \u201cnon-doms\u201d, wealthy foreigners who live in Britain and are domiciled abroad. The budget delivered in the House of Commons on Wednesday by chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, contained few surprises, however. It also failed to deliver the income tax cuts coveted by many Tory MPs as a weapon for the general election this year that Labour is the favourite to win. The budget, which also included a \u00a335 billion (\u20ac41 billion) efficiency drive in public services, was rejected by Labour Party leader Sir  Keir Starmer  as a \u201cTory con\u201d because so-called \u201cstealth taxes\u201d, such as rises in council taxes, are set to wipe out any gains for workers from the national insurance cut. Mr Hunt\u2019s flagship, well-trailed announcement was a two percentage-point cut in the national insurance rate, bringing the main rate down from 10 per cent to 8 per cent. He said this would put \u00a3450 (\u20ac526) back into the pocket of the average British worker, and follows a similar cut six months ago in the UK government\u2019s autumn financial statement. He also signalled that, given the chance in future, he plans to completely phase out national insurance. He suggested it is an unfair tax on employment; national insurance is charged only on wages and not on passive income such as that earned from investments. Although Mr Hunt did not deliver income tax cuts, he suggested that the UK is on a \u201cpath to lower taxes\u201d in future. He announced 12-month freezes in alcohol and fuel duties and a levy on vaping. Other measures that are likely to go down badly with traditional Tory voters include an increase in the duty paid by business-class air passengers and the abolition of tax breaks for second home owners who rent them out as holiday homes. Mr Hunt also extended by a year, to 2029, a windfall tax on profits by North Sea oil companies, which he said would raise \u00a31.5 billion. This move aped another Labour pre-election pledge. However, it angered the Scottish National Party and also the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, whose Moray constituency in affluent northeast Scotland sits adjacent to the Aberdeen hub of the North Sea hydrocarbons industry. Mr Ross said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and would not vote for the legislation required to implement the measure. The abolition of the controversial \u201cnon-dom\u201d system, which gives tax breaks on worldwide income for UK residents who are tax domiciled elsewhere, had also been well-flagged in advance. The system has been used by, among others, Akshata Murty, the wife of prime minister Rishi Sunak, who recused himself from discussions on the policy, Downing Street confirmed. The non-dom system will be replaced by a new regime based on residency with all previous non-dom beneficiaries due to pay the same tax as British citizens after four years\u2019 residency. Following the budget, Labour and the Tories traded barbs over Britain\u2019s overall debt levels, which are still on the rise. Mr Hunt said UK government borrowing would fall over the next five years to 1.2 per cent of GDP, although Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said he would \u201ctake this with a pinch of salt\u201d. The UK economy is technically in a shallow recession, but growth is expected to resume later in the year at 0.8 per cent overall for 2024, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility.

The scheme comes for sale fully occupied by a strong selection of international and Irish retailers at a guide price of \u20ac55,175,000. The sale of the property at that level offers the new owner the opportunity to secure a net initial yield of 8.81 per cent based upon the current rent roll, which is in excess of \u20ac5 million.

Global Risk Partners (GRP), an insurance intermediary, said its first deal in the Republic signals the company's intention to seek further acquisitions. Crotty Insurance, an independent commercial insurance broker, has been in business for 25 years and has a diverse corporate client base and has established specialisms in renewable energy, construction, and professional services industries. Crotty was advised in the sale by financial advisory firm Key Capital. Acquisitions \"We're delighted to be bringing such a well-respected and successful business on board and to be entering the Republic of Ireland's thriving insurance sector,\" said Stephen Ross, head of mergers and acquisitions for GRP. Founded in 2013, GRP has written gross premiums in excess of \u00a3800 million and employs more than 1,600 staff. In June 2020, private equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners acquired a majority stake in GRP. In 2018, the latest year for which accounts are available, Crotty Insurance Brokers Limited posted turnover of \u20ac2.7 million and recorded a profit before tax of \u20ac831,121. While no price on the deal was forthcoming from the parties, industry sources noted the the sale of broker Arachas, for about \u20ac250 million by a UK brokerage group, was done on about 14 times earnings. GRP\u2019s move into the Republic will sees further consolidation in the market and may be positive news for smaller brokers seeking to sell their business. Sources in the industry suggested that smaller deals can often trade at about eight or nine times earnings. Growth Finbarr Crotty, founder of Crotty Insurance, said the sale was \u201cfantastic\u201d. \u201cWe have worked very hard to build a successful business and earn our reputation in the market and we\u2019re delighted that GRP has recognised the value of what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d he said. Mike Bruce, GRP's chief executive, said: \"We've always seen Ireland as a great opportunity to grow the business beyond the UK, so we're very pleased with this deal and look forward to further growth.\" Finbarr Crotty, as well as Eoin Greene and Graham Devine, will remain as executives, directors and shareholders in the business. Mr Crotty will take up the position of executive chairman while Mr Greene will become chief executive of the group.",

The decline in premiums reflects the final premium paid, not the initial renewal quote offered by the current insurer, with the online broker warning that drivers who opt to auto-renew their cover are missing out on savings. \"We have software-based processes in place to compare the market for each customer at each renewal,\" said Coverinaclick.ie managing director Jonathan Hehir. \u201cMotorists should ultimately be switching on every two to three years.\u201d The latest consumer price index from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) reports that car insurance figures have reduced by about 6 per cent over the last 12 months, but this group includes people who accepted their renewal premium from the existing insurer, Mr Hehir said. \u201cIf one insurer is reducing its price, you can be sure that many others are also doing so, as it has become a very competitive market,\u201d he added. Fragmented product Coverinaclick.ie said the approach each insurer takes to driver risk profiles varies hugely and changes frequently. \u201cMotor insurance is one of the most fragmented products out there when it comes to pricing and quotes can vary wildly from person to person, and insurer to insurer.

            "date": "2021-04-22",
            "raw_text": "There is \"not a hope\" that insurance premiums will start coming down quickly following the introduction into force of new guidelines on personal injury awards, according to a Law Society spokesman. From this Saturday the new compensation guidelines, which were adopted by the Judicial Council in March after a vote among the State's judges, will come into effect. They are expected to introduce reductions of up to 50 per cent in the size of general damages awards for minor to middle-range injuries, which constitute approximately 80 per cent of all claims. The guidelines are also being adopted from this weekend by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), which assesses all claims that have not been settled directly, in a bid to stop such claims proceeding to litigation. Bodies representing business and wider society have called on the insurance sector to begin reducing premiums from Monday, but Stuart Gilhooly, a former president of the Law Society, said he did not expect this to happen. \u201cOn no Monday do I expect [premiums] to come down, no less this one,\u201d said the solicitor, who has spoken for the body that represents the State\u2019s solicitors in the debate over the reasons behind Ireland\u2019s high insurance costs. \u2018Line their pockets\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ve said from the word go that this is a ruse, and that is what it is, a ruse for the insurance industry to line their pockets to an even greater extent than before.\u201d He said the guidelines would lead to \u201csavage cuts\u201d in the damages paid for smaller whiplash injuries, and also see many cases being heard in lower courts, where the legal costs are smaller. However, the insurance industry will come up with a reason not to pass the resultant savings on to the consumer. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably throw a few crumbs from the table, I\u2019d say. A little bit like last year, when they gave us all \u20ac30 back on our premiums when there were no accidents at all.\u201d The Government was mistaken when it accepted the insurance industry\u2019s argument that cutting award levels would lead to lower premiums, he said. However, the director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, Peter Boland, said it expected that insurance premium charges should be \"significantly reduced\" from Monday. \u201cIf you renew from Monday, the financial risk associated with your policy is going to be significantly reduced.\u201d Compensation costs Therefore, he said, the alliance, which represents civic and business organisations, expects premiums to be significant reduced also, starting from Monday. Neil McDonnell, the chief executive of the small and medium-sized business association, Isme, said that approximately 40 per cent of motor insurance premiums goes on compensation. On that basis, a 50 per cent cut in small and medium-sized awards should lead to a cut of approximately 20 per cent in motor insurance premiums. He said the reduced costs that would now be associated with most accidents should be immediately reflected in liability and motor insurance premiums. The establishment of PIAB in 2004 led to an immediate drop in the size of insurance premiums that persisted for five years, he said. Insurance Ireland, which represents the industry, said \u201ccompetition law prevents us from commenting on future pricing\u201d. The guidelines were a \u201cvery important step that will help us reduce costs over time\u201d, the representative body said, and it was \u201coptimistic for the future of insurance in Ireland\u201d. The new guidelines should ultimately result in personal injury claims being processed more efficiently and consistently, it said in a statement. The need for expensive litigation will diminish over time and \u201cwe all need to work now to ensure that the consumer benefits\u201d from these and other changes. \u201cThe market is very competitive and is very capable of reacting to the proposed lower cost of claims,\u201d the statement said.",

Liberty Insurance Ireland left the commercial market here two years ago, leaving no Irish-based insurance underwriter for the sport. There are more than 100 point-to-point events held per season and these are organised by local hunt club committees with the Irish Horse Racing Board (IHRB) acting as the administrator. The majority of the hunt clubs in Ireland are involved in running amateur or point-to-point racing across the country. Point-to-points The overseas insurer has not been renewing cover for hunt clubs, which run the majority of the amateur meetings known as point-to-points. Insurance costs for clubs over the past year for race meetings had doubled and tripled, in some cases bringing their premiums to \u20ac12,000 and upwards. Galway man Derek O\u2019Connor who is the country\u2019s top amateur point-to-point rider of all time \u2013 holding nine titles and with more than 1,200 winners \u2013 said the livelihoods of hundreds of people were being put on the line over the insurance cover crisis. He said: \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about jobs, it\u2019s about the rural way of life and all that is associated with this. The racing industry is just one of several sectors drastically affected by insurance issues that have not been addressed properly here for years.\u201d Race meetings understood to be facing immediate collapse in insurance cover are in Tipperary, Wicklow, Dublin, Meath, Carlow and Laois. Hunt clubs Niall Cronin, IHRB spokesman, said the ongoing impasse is \u201cdefinitely affecting\u201d a lot of people working in the industry and is \u201csuch a big concern\u201d. He confirmed several meetings are continuing to be held by the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee of the IHRB, insurance industry representatives and hunt clubs management along with Government officials but no progress has been made to date. Minister of State at the Department of Finance Se\u00e1n Fleming, who is representing the Government on the issue, held a series of meetings with the chief executives of the eight major insurers based in Ireland two weeks ago.His department said: \u201cThe Government is acutely aware of the concerns felt by some parts of the equestrian and various other sectors regarding the cost and availability of insurance. \u201cFurthermore . . . [Mr Fleming] . . . is planning to examine issues around the provision of cover in niche areas such as equestrian events in the coming weeks with representatives of the insurance and broker industries.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "The Central Bank revealed on Tuesday that it is wavering on a proposal to make insurers secure customers' written consent before setting their policies to renew automatically at the end of a period of coverage. However, it is sticking to a plan to ban the widespread practice of motor and home insurers increasing premiums for loyal customers by stealth from July. This is known as \u201cprice walking\u201d, where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurer. The regulator said the idea that automatic renewals be an \u201copt-in\u201d, rather than an \u201copt-out\u201d, for customers needs \u201cfurther consideration to avoid the risk of any unintended consequences, including any scenarios that might lead to consumers finding themselves without critical insurance cover\u201d, particularly in the areas of health and motor insurance. The practice amounts to an insurance provider automatically renewing a contract at the end of a coverage period, unless the customer says otherwise. The Central Bank proposal on this matter received a lot of pushback from participants in a public consultation, with objections including the fact that it could expose customers to coverage lapses. It will likely be next year before the Central Bank decides on whether \u201copt-ins\u201d will be required, officials told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday. The regulator will require, in the meantime, that insurance providers send information to customers in before automatic renewals kick in, including the right to cancel and switch coverage. \u2018Price walking\u2019 Meanwhile, the ban on \u201cprice walking\u201d in insurance in the motor and home insurance market will come into effect from July 1st, in line with proposals set out nine months ago. This means that insurers cannot charge personal consumers who are on their second or subsequent renewal a premium that is higher than what they would have charged them if they were on their first renewal. The rules stop short of following a UK move last May to effectively prohibit insurers from offering below-cost discounts to lure new customers from the start of this year. The Central Bank's director general of financial conduct, Derville Rowland, defended the Irish approach, based on the regulator's research into data covering a three-year period and 90 per cent of the market. \u201cOur own insights told us that when we looked at this, there is a significant value attached for new customers to get discounts where they\u2019re available,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw that particularly, for example, for younger drivers, where the cost of insurance can be very high. And we were persuaded that we saw a merit in that option being available.\u201d The Central Bank estimated in a report published last July that customers who stay with the same car insurer for nine years or more pay 14 per cent more than a driver with a similar risk profile renewing for the first time. The disparity is even starker in home insurance, where the difference averages 32 per cent. Central Bank officials were not able to provide overall monetary estimates of how much Irish households could expect to save in a given year from its proposal. Annual review Insurers and brokers will be required in future to carry out an annual review of motor and home insurance pricing policies and processes to ensure sound practices. The new measures are being enforced almost three years after the regulator decided to look into the issue of differential pricing in insurance. Work published last year by the Central Bank estimated the extent to which loyal customers are paying over the odds for coverage by comparing actual premiums with a \u201ctechnical premium\u201d, which is an insurer\u2019s view of the cost of pricing the policy. Where new motor customers typically benefit from a 2 per cent discount to the technical premium, someone who has been with an insurer for at least nine years is charged, on average, 25 per cent more than the break-even threshold.",

The company recorded the increase after revenues rose by 10.5 per cent from \u20ac23 million to \u20ac25.5 million in the 12 months to the end of April last, according to new accounts filed by Chill Insurance Ltd. The directors stated the company\u2019s earnings before interest, depreciation, tax, depreciation and amortisation last year more than doubled to \u20ac6.7 million. They said \u201cthe company expects profitability to grow substantially over the coming 12 months\u201d.

Mr Justice Conor Dignam made the order appointing chartered accountant and insolvency expert Damien Harper as liquidator of the company, founded by bankrupt former billionaire Sean Quinn. The insolvency of Quinn Insurance cost the taxpayer some \u20ac1 billion in payments from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), which is used to compensate policyholders when an insurance company enters liquidation.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 The government took the decision to place the insurer into administration following the collapse of Sean Quinn\u2019s business empire during the economic recession and banking crisis. The application to appoint Mr Harper was made on behalf of the company\u2019s joint administrators Michael McAteer and Paul McCann, of Grant Thornton. Senior counsel for the company Garvan Corkery told the court the application was being made as all outstanding business of the administration has been completed. Should the League of Ireland be an all-island competition? The company was clearly insolvent, has no assets and there is no reality that its debt to the ICF can be met, counsel said. The company was run by the administrators and has been under the supervision of four different presidents of the High Court since 2010. Counsel said the insurance business\u2019s undertaking was sold to Liberty Insurance in 2011. All of its other assets, subsidiaries and undertakings have been dealt with and any value realised, counsel added. The last significant piece of business involving Quinn Insurance was the administrators\u2019 High Court action alleging negligence against the firm\u2019s auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers alleging negligence from 2005 to 2008. This case was settled last year, counsel added. Mr Justice David Barniville, president of the High Court, had consented to the winding up application being made, counsel added.

The company\u2019s profit rose to \u20ac30.9 million from \u20ac22.9 million for 2021, as turnover, mainly composed of commissions and fees, advanced to \u20ac89.4 million from \u20ac61 million, according to newly-filed accounts with the Companies Registration Office. Arachas, which has been one the most acquisitive brokerage groups in the Republic in recent times, paid out \u20ac77.7 million in dividends last year to holding companies within the wider corporate family, according to the filings. The company, led by chief executive Conor Brennan, itself was acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a UK brokerage group that is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Partners, for \u20ac250 million. Arachas\u2019s growth last year was supported by integration of recent acquisitions, such as Waterford-based Hooper Dolan Insurances, Dublin-based Stuart Insurances and Apex Insurance in Cork. An Arachas acquisition vehicle also transferred recent-purchased brokerages including Glennon Insurances in Dublin and Limerick-based O\u2019Malley-Griffin to Arachas Corporate Brokers in March of this year. \u201cArachas has continued to grow strongly in 2023 with the Glennon acquisition performing excellently and our appropriate, cost-effective insurance products attracting new customers,\u201d said John McCarthy, chief financial officer at Arachas and Ardonagh Europe. \u201cOur employment numbers have now increased to 700 people at our network of 18 offices throughout the country.\u201d The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. Mr McCreevy, who was minister for finance between 1997 and 2004 and subsequently served as European commissioner for internal markets for over five years, joined the board of Arachas following the company\u2019s 2019 purchase of Galway-based brokerage, Murray & Spelman, where he was chairman.",

Transactions totalling \u20ac190.6 million were conducted last year for country homes \u2013 properties outside the main cities and the M50 corridor \u2013 each valued at more than \u20ac1 million. The figure was slightly below but broadly in line with that of 2022, itself a bumper year for transactions. [\u00a0 Does it make sense to leave our Irish home to children living abroad? \u00a0] James Butler, head of country agency at Savills Ireland, said the majority of buyers at this end of the market are cash purchasers, many of them living abroad. Some are Irish and hoping to return to the Republic after working in another country for a time while others are foreign buyers looking to put down roots here, he said. The county with the most transactions at this end of the market was Kildare, at 27. Cork \u2013 a perennial favourite among buyers, Mr Butler said, particularly around Kinsale \u2013 was second with 24, followed by Co Meath with 19 sales and Co Wicklow with three. [\u00a0 We had to go abroad for work. Will we be taxed on sale of our home? \u00a0] One of the largest single transactions in 2023 was the \u20ac4.5 million sale of Sprayfield House, Sandycove, near Kinsale in July to US billionaire James Berwind. At least half of the transactions are to people based abroad. \u201cThe key change in the last couple of years is in the number of transactions that have taken place. The number of buyers actively looking for a prime country property has increased and therefore the number of actual transactions has increased,\u201d Mr Butler said. More people are also thought to want to return to the Republic because of the performance of the economy. \u201cThe other key reason is working habits are changing and flexible work has become more common,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople therefore look at living further afield from their office because they can spend either all of the time or some of the time working from home and typically those people hold more senior roles within a business.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

            "raw_text": "Colm Berry says insurance costs \u201cwrecked\u201d his business after his premium rose 25-fold in just five years. The Dubliner set up Woodlands Segways in 2014, bringing 10 battery-powered, two-wheeled \u201cpersonal transporters\u201d to Lough Key Forest Park in Co Roscommon. Insurance cost him \u20ac1,200 in his first year in business. By 2019 he got a quote of \u20ac30,000, which, with an annual turnover of about \u20ac60,000, wasn\u2019t feasible. \u201cToday you just couldn\u2019t get insurance,\u201d he says. The Segways, which travel at about the speed of a bicycle, quickly become a key attraction in the park where zip wires and a tree-top walk make it a popular family holiday destination. But when a woman walked into Berry\u2019s office in August 2015 and complained she had been knocked to the ground after being hit by a Segway, he knew he was in trouble. The Segway guided tours were along trails shared with pedestrians and cyclists and one Segway user had swerved to avoid someone, before skidding on wet ground and colliding with the woman. Berry agrees the woman had a grievance but was \u201cshocked\u201d when two years later she was awarded \u20ac25,000 by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) for what he says was \u201csoft tissue damage\u201d. He had always insisted two staff accompany clients on the tours, one in front and one at the back, and recalls when the woman complained, \u201cI told her it could wipe me out. \u201cI have no problem with her. She was out in the park minding her own business when this happened. It is the level of awards I have a problem with,\u201d he says. While Segways were new to people in 2014, he quickly built up a clientele and excellent reviews on Tripadvisor, but says the accident \u201cthrew a spanner in the works\u201d. He was \u201cpetrified\u201d there might be another accident so he stopped taking corporate bookings for team-building exercises. He also lived in fear of the next insurance quote. The year after the accident his premium rose to \u20ac3,500 \u201cwhich was actually a relief\u201d but there were substantial increases in the following years, to \u20ac5,000, then \u20ac10,000 \u201cand then it went bananas\u201d. At the end of 2019 the quote was \u20ac30,000 so he shut up shop. \u201cInsurance is just a killer,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery year there was stress, wondering if we would get insured. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise there\u2019s a human cost behind every claim. In this case absolutely it was our fault but even if people fall because they are going too fast, some will try to apportion blame.\u201d He is disappointed that after making a substantial financial investment and taking a risk, the insurance situation \u201cwrecked\u201d his business. He estimates the total set-up costs were in the region of \u20ac100,000. \u201cYou try to do something entrepreneurial and get something going in rural Ireland and it comes back to bite you,\u201d he said. The 47-year-old biochemist by profession has secured a temporary job testing water samples. \u201cSo now I\u2019m in a job earning what I first earned when I came out of college.\u201d Dramatic reform Unless there is dramatic reform he would be reluctant to recommend anyone to start an outdoor activity business. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d say don\u2019t touch it with a barge pole.\u201d Among the factors he believes need addressing are the size of the awards, and the culture of a lack of personal responsibility. \u201cAnd I think the legal profession are driving it too,\u201d he says. With so many insurers exiting the market, he does not think they are \u201cmaking a killing\u201d. He still owns a fleet of 10 Segways worth \u20ac6,000 each but he doesn\u2019t anticipate anyone buying the Segways because of the problem getting insurance. His company website is still live but is advising clients that it is closed down for 2021. The messages doesn\u2019t sound hopeful: \u201cWe will try to secure insurance for next year but due to the claims culture, large compensation payouts and lack of real insurance and legal reform at the moment, we are not hopeful for the future,\u201d it notes.",

Cover of up to \u20ac500,000 per applicant is to be allowed under the revised code, a ceiling Insurance Ireland says covers more than 90 per cent of mortgage protection policies issued in the State. \u2018It\u2019s an eye-opener\u2019: The Irish medics training Ukrainian lawyers, vets and photographers to help the war effort \u2018It\u2019s an eye-opener\u2019: The Irish medics training Ukrainian lawyers, vets and photographers to help the war effort The changes follow discussion between the industry and the Irish Cancer Society (ICS) after the charity published a report in 2021 highlighting the difficulties many cancer survivors experienced in accessing the necessary life cover to obtain a mortgage. The European Commission is formulating plans for a right to be forgotten for cancer survivors, designed to prevent financial discrimination and increase their rights. Insurance Ireland says its code of conduct goes beyond the commission\u2019s proposed provisions for mortgage amounts of \u20ac200,000 or less and a period of 15 years since the end of cancer treatment. [\u00a0 Call for cancers to be \u2018forgotten\u2019 when seeking financial services \u00a0] The code of conduct, which is voluntary, \u201cappropriately balances the needs of cancer survivors without causing a reduction in availability of cover for other consumers\u201d, according to the industry body. It claims the revised rules, which members have six months to implement, will lead to a \u201cfaster, more streamlined process\u201d. Separately, a report from the Society of Actuaries in Ireland warns the cost of life insurance is likely to rise across the board if cancer survivors are given a right to be forgotten. Fewer life insurance products may be sold, depending on how much premiums rise, as some consumers feel unfairly treated, it says. Life insurance would become more affordable for some cancer survivors and this can be expected to lead to more of them taking out policies, the report finds. However, consumers who have recovered from other illnesses or diseases may feel unfairly treated as they would still be required to disclose their prior condition. More than 20 million Europeans, including 200,000 people in Ireland, have recovered from cancer. Sixty per cent of respondents to a 2021 ICS survey said they had difficulties when applying for mortgages, loans and insurance, and 40 per cent felt they had been treated unfairly. About 17,000 cancer survivors applied for life insurance over an eight-year period \u2013 1.7 per cent of all applications \u2013 a working group established by the society estimates in the report, based on records from three of the six insurers in the Irish market. An estimated 10,000 of these said their cancer treatment ended more than five years previously \u2013 about 1 per cent of applicants. None of these applications was automatically accepted. An estimated 8,500 were referred to an underwriter for individual consideration, with the remainder declined or postponed for re-assessment after at least six months. Insurance Ireland says applicants who disclose a cancer diagnosis are not automatically declined cover, and many obtain it at either standard rates or with an additional cost. [\u00a0 Using AI to detect breast cancer that doctors miss \u00a0] The working group behind the report asked the six life insurers to assess notional applications from cancer survivors. This showed the severity of previous cancer was a factor in underwriting decisions. Some said they would accept applications from cancer survivors with no extra premium payable both five and 10 years post the completion of treatment, particularly where the cancer was early-stage or a small tumour with no spread. \u201cHowever, the majority of insurers did indicate applications are likely to be declined for the most significantly advanced cases regardless of when treatment ended.\u201d The group says its findings may be more material for other products such as serious illness or income protection. Welcoming the report, the ICS called on the Government to progress legislation currently in the Seanad that would enshrine the right to be forgotten five years post-treatment. \u201cSupporting people who have gone through the application process, we have learned the uncertainty of the underwriting decision can lead to increased anxiety, demoralisation and distress, even for those who left cancer behind many years ago,\u201d said its head of advocacy Rachel Morrough.",

The company highlighted the figure for \u201ctotal compensation to those employees classified as key management\u201d in its latest solvency and financial condition report, published on its website. The corresponding figure for 2019 was \u20ac2 million. A spokesman declined to comment on what led to the increase or how many employees fell under this category in each of the past two years. Aviva Insurance Ireland's former chief executive, John Quinlan, officially left the company late last year, after dropping legal proceedings against the company. Mr Quinlan, who joined Aviva as general insurance managing director in 2013 from RSA Insurance Ireland, went on leave in late 2019 and launched legal proceedings against his employer last July. Notice of discontinuance The action was taken within weeks of it emerging that Declan O'Rourke, then general manager of US insurance giant AIG's Irish business, had been tapped to become the next chief executive of Aviva's Irish general insurance arm. A so-called notice of discontinuance of the case was filed with the High Court on December 7th. Mr O'Rourke took over top executive duties last September from Nick Amin, a senior Aviva group executive who was dispatched in late 2019 to take on the role of interim chief executive of the Irish unit. Mr Amin subsequently became the wider group's chief operating officer. Other senior Aviva Insurance Ireland departures last year included John Farrell, former head of claims; Robert Kennedy, former head of sales; and Michelle White, former head of marketing. Aviva is known within the industry to have relatively high rates of senior executive turnover, both at Irish and group level. Group structures Aviva Insurance Ireland saw its operating profit fall to \u20ac35 million last year from \u20ac54 million. This was mainly the result of net premiums dropping 7 per cent to \u20ac440 million, mainly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as higher expenses. London-based Aviva reorganised its Irish business in September 2019 to align itself with the structures of the group. This eliminated the position of Aviva Ireland chief executive and left Mr Quinlan in charge of the general insurance business, Aviva Insurance Ireland, with the life and pensions business, Aviva Life & Pensions Ireland, headed up by another executive. Aviva appointed Dave Elliot, who has been with the group for almost a decade, as chief executive of the Irish life and pensions division last summer, succeeding Tom Browne, who joined the business in 2018 through the acquisition of Friends First. Mr Browne retired last July after 40 years working in the insurance industry in Ireland.",

            "raw_text": "The Government, which pledged on its formation in June to work to stamp out dual pricing in the insurance market, will not tackle the issue until after the Central Bank publishes a final report on matter next September, according to the minister responsible for insurance reform. While Sinn F\u00e9in is seeking to push through a Bill early next year banning customers of a similar risk profile being charged different rates by the same insurer, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance Se\u00e1n Fleming told the Oireachtas finance committee on Tuesday that the Government will not move on the issue until the regulator issues its full report. It comes as Central Bank, which moved late last year to start a review of differential, or dual, pricing, made an initial finding in September that the practice was more common in the motor and home insurance markets than coverage providers had admitted. Meanwhile, the bank said in an interim report into the topic on Monday that homeowners sticking with the same provider typically face a \u201cloyalty premium\u201d of \u20ac161 a year. The Labour Party published proposed laws this week that would prohibit dual pricing across multiple industries. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) moved recently to ban the practice outright in the insurance market, while in the US, it is outlawed in some 20 states, including New York and Florida. 66-point action plan The Government published a 66-point action plan early last week aimed at bringing down Irish insurance costs. Points included using incoming judicial guidelines on personal injury award levels to replace the Personal Injuries Assessment Board\u2019s book of quantum and making it easier for perjury to be prosecuted, in an effort to reduce levels of fraudulent claims. A Government-commissioned report showed two years ago that awards for soft tissue injuries, or whiplash, in the Republic are more than four times greater than those in the UK. Mr Fleming said he will write to the chief executives of the main insurance firms operating in the State, of which FBD is the only indigenous company, looking for commitments that each will lower insurance rates as most of the measures in the action plan are set to be completed by the end of next year. He said that PIAB and judges working off same personal injury awards guidelines, set to take effect from the end of next July, should see fewer claimants bypassing the State-run injuries board and resorting to the courts. However, the Oireachtas Finance Committee\u2019s chairman, John McGuinness, said insurance reform efforts by the last government were \u201chopeless\u201d and questioned whether the latest round would deliver results for consumers. The average Irish motor premium rose by 66 per cent from a low point of \u20ac431 in the final three months of 2013 to \u20ac714 in the second quarter of 2018 before dropping 9 per cent to \u20ac653 in late 2019, according to a Central Bank report published last month. Insurers operating in the Republic saw profits on motor coverage lines surge by 9 per cent to \u20ac142 million last year, as the loss ratio hovered around the lowest levels of the past decade, Central Bank figures show.",

            "raw_text": "A man who acted as a \u201cghost broker\u201d for his friends and acquaintances, giving false information to car insurance companies to get cheaper policies, has been ordered to carry out community service. Vasile Braileanu (43) was on Friday ordered to carry out 240 hours of community service in lieu of a two year prison term for defrauding a number of motor insurance companies of about \u20ac13,000. Braileanu, of Adamstown Avenue, Lucan, Co Dublin, pleaded guilty to 15 fraud-related offences, including dishonestly inducing insurance companies to give policies at a reduced premiums and making, using and possessing false documents such as no claims discount and experienced driver certificates. Braileanu committed the ghost broker offences between April 2015 and November 2017, when his house was searched by garda\u00ed\u00ad who had been tipped off to his operation. He also admitted to being the customer of a ghost broker in September 2013, when he got a cheaper premium and then became interested in doing it himself, the court heard. Garda George Thurlow told John Byrne BL, prosecuting, that when interviewed, Braileanu admitted to brokering 30 policies for friends and acquaintances using fake documents. However, investigating garda\u00ed only found evidence of 10 policies that had been brokered. Braileanu said he received about \u20ac400-\u20ac600 in payment for brokering each policy. In one example, he got a motor insurance premium from Allianz Insurance down from \u20ac1292 to \u20ac692 by submitting false documents, the court heard. Garda\u00ed searching his home found a \u201cghost brokering kit\u201d and templates for documents such as \u201cno claims discount\u201d and \u201cexperienced driver\u201d certificates. Garda Thurlow agreed with defence counsel that Braileanu was at the lower end of the scale compared to other ghost brokering operations he had investigated. \u201cIt was a small operation and an amateur operation,\u201d he said. Braileanu did not advertise his business on social media but operated by \u201cword of mouth\u201d, the court heard. He is originally from Moldova and has a wife and two children. He holds a degree in construction but was working as a bus driver up until the pandemic. He is now on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Sentencing Braileanu, Judge Martin Nolan said he was acting as a \u201cshadow agent\u201d to induce insurance companies to issue cheaper insurance policies. \u201cIt seems impossible to believe that his customers didn\u2019t know that something suspicious was happening,\u201d he said. The court heard that the fraudulent insurance polices were cancelled once they were discovered, but the customers who took them out were treated as injured parties. Judge Nolan accepted it was an amateur operation and he ordered Braileanu to carry out 240 hours of community service. He adjourned the case to July 7th, to ascertain that Braileanu is deemed suitable.",

            "raw_text": "Senior Ministers have been drafted in to strengthen the Government\u2019s approach to insurance reform after the previous administration\u2019s efforts to bring down costs to consumers fell short. The Irish Times has learned that a high-level meeting took place this week involving five senior Ministers, as the Government seeks to bring extra political and departmental muscle to bear on the long-standing issue of high insurance costs and compensation payouts. Talks this week on how to reform the sector were attended by T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar; Minister for Justice Helen McEntee; Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe; Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath; and Minister for Children Roderic O'Gorman, who spoke to the meeting about the costs of insurance to the childcare sector. The insurance sector has traditionally been the responsibility of a junior minister in the Department of Finance, but sources said several Cabinet Ministers would play a \"hands on\" role in an effort to deliver on promises made in the programme for government. \u2018Competitive issues\u2019 The reform agenda will still be led, however, by a junior minister in the Department of Finance. This week's meeting was chaired by Jack Chambers, who was since reappointed as government chief whip in the wake of Barry Cowen's dismissal from Cabinet. Incoming Minister of State Sean Fleming will continue to lead the project, it is understood. The programme for government promises to \u201cprioritise reform of the insurance sector\u201d and to address high claim payouts and \u201ccompetitive issues\u201d to build an insurance system \u201cwhich is affordable and reliable and underpins a vibrant economy\u201d. Sources said that previous efforts to reform the sector had partially fallen flat due to a lack of political capital invested by Cabinet ministers in the reform programme. The previous government, with then minister of state Michael D'Arcy in charge of the brief, convened a costs of insurance working group (CIWG), which was composed of officials from the Department of Finance, Central Bank, Department of Business and the Department of Justice, as well as the State Claims Agency and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Consumer-facing segments However, reform efforts often struggled to get purchase due to the lack of ministerial involvement in line with ministries directly associated with different aspects of the issue, figures involved in the last administration said. Government sources believe that delivering early on the issue in the new government\u2019s term, especially in consumer-facing segments like motor insurance, would resonate with voters. While it is understood that this week\u2019s meeting did not address specific policy proposals, the programme for government outlines a range of potential interventions, with an emphasis on motor, public liability and employer liability insurance. These include an enhanced and reformed role for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the regulation of claims management companies and claims harvesters. It will also consider the need for a constitutional amendment, and an associated referendum, which would enable the Oireachtas to set down guidelines on award levels. It also promises to expand the Garda Economic Crime Bureau and increase the penalties for fraudulent claims, and place perjury on a statutory footing, making the offence easier to prosecute. A spokesman for the Department of Finance said the Government\u2019s intended work on insurance \u201cbuilds and expands upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group\u201d. \u201cThe purpose of this week\u2019s Ministerial meeting was to discuss how to take forward the implementation of this cross departmental insurance reform agenda.\u201d",

            "date": "2023-08-30",
            "raw_text": "There are only a few things in life we spend our hard-earned money on while hoping we will never have to use. Fire extinguishers, Imodium and CPR courses all rank highly on that list but usually insurance is the one product we purchase to protect against worst-case scenarios, while crossing our fingers hoping they don\u2019t arrive. Nearly half the population has private health insurance, with 43.7 per cent of us covered, according to Health Insurance Authority (HIA) figures from March 2023. There are several pull factors encouraging consumers to take up health insurance, like the option of a private room, choice of consultant and additional benefits such as acupuncture. The unfortunate reality of the health system in Ireland, where  reports  of over 830,000 patients on hospital waiting lists are common, however, means people feel insurance is a necessity. Younger people are encouraged to get health insurance earlier but this is tricky for a cohort struggling with high rents, junior salaries, eye-watering house deposits and childcare costs. Coughing up anywhere between \u20ac500-\u20ac1,500 a year for a plan on top of the cost of living crisis is a big ask. Only 38.9 per cent of the population aged between 18 and 29 had coverage last year, according to the HIA market report. That number jumps to 44.1 per cent for 30 to 39-year-olds. This is where the Lifetime Community Rating kicks in, which makes insurance progressively more expensive for anyone 35 and up joining for the first time. And it\u2019s set to get worse. Big insurers in the market like Irish Health and Laya are in to their second round of price hikes this year. So, how can health insurance first-timers or under 40s looking to switch get the best deal when there\u2019s over 300 plans to choose? Here\u2019s some tips to get you started. Cheapest doesn\u2019t always mean the best deal Cheapest doesn\u2019t always mean the best deal Going with the no-frills plan because you feel young, healthy and have yet to see inside of a hospital might cost you more in the long run. Health insurance expert Dermot Goode, who  compares policies for a living , said younger customers often \u201cwant to spend as little as possible if they are healthy or don\u2019t have medical history\u201d. [\u00a0 Student finances: The supports that can help reduce the \u20ac1,500-a-month costs \u00a0] While basic policies start around \u20ac500 and will cover some costs, consumers could be left with sticker shock on high excess bills or outpatient costs, such as consultants fees. \u201cThey\u2019ve stripped almost everything back. It\u2019s like going out to buy a car and coming back with a moped \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be pretty,\u201d explained Goode While taking care to emphasise that \u201ceveryone is price conscious at the minute\u201d and that people can only get a plan they can afford, Goode said it\u2019s important to figure out if the consumer going for the basic package would be able to pay for the things it didn\u2019t cover. \u201cOne thing younger people miss is the consultants fees. It\u2019s important to think about what would happen if they developed a medical problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore you are even brought into hospital, you go to the GP. The GP is going to send you to a consultant which, privately, could cost \u20ac250-300 for the first visit. The consultant might need an ultrasound, an X-ray or bloods, which all costs, and then you have to go back to the consultant again and pay another fee before you even get into hospital. \u201cPeople can spend \u20ac500-800 on routine diagnostics, which you have to do before going to the hospital. Some basic plans only kick in when you get admitted to hospital but for anything before and after, you pretty much get nothing back.\u201d The other thing to watch is excess. This is the money not covered by your insurance for certain procedures, hospital stays or even some outpatient benefits. \u201cFor an extra \u20ac100 or \u20ac200 in some cases, you might be able to buy a policy with an excess of only \u20ac250, instead of \u20ac500, so you would be better off if you needed a procedure,\u201d said Goode. The gamble is: do I want to pay more for something that might not happen? Or will I end up with a large, nasty bill due to an unforeseen illness or injury? \u201cIn a lot of cases, it comes down to risk,\u201d said Christina Prendergast, head of communication for the Health Authority Ireland. \u201cIf you are willing to take on the risk of paying part of the cost, choosing a policy with an excess can result in a lower premium. If you are not willing to accept this risk, you can choose a product without an excess.\u201d Know thyself Know thyself One of the mistakes Goode sees with younger customers is the belief their fit and active lifestyle means they don\u2019t need things like private hospital, clinic cover or outpatient benefits. When, actually, it could be the opposite. [\u00a0 AI can help you save, but don\u2019t rely on it to fix your finances \u00a0] \u201cI might see a healthy 25-year-old who only wants to pay \u20ac900 for cover but turns out they are very active, play GAA or rugby and they might need physio or acupuncture or access to a rapid clinic or they tear their ACL and they want to see the best consultant to get back training as soon as possible,\u201d he said \u201cFor an extra \u20ac300 on a plan, they can get up to \u20ac1,000 back in benefits.\u201d This is particularly true for people looking to access counselling or other mental healthcare. While most plans will have inpatient psychiatric coverage, outpatient benefits can vary wildly. Some plans may cover 50 per cent of all visits, others may only cover up to five, some none at all. This means \u20ac70 weekly visits can add up. According to Goode, this is where corporate plans might be a good option. \u201cAnyone can join these, despite the name. Always include an employee assistance programme, which gives you 24/7 access to a qualified counsellor on any issues bothering you.\u201d Aside from your lifestyle or medical history to consider, it\u2019s also important to factor in what your future might look like in the next few years when deciding on insurance. \u201cFor example, you might be planning to have a baby, in which case outpatient cover and maternity cover might be of particular interest to you,\u201d advised Prendergast. Timing is key Timing is key Okay, so you might need a higher level cover as your knees start to go playing football or if you plan to have a baby. The smart thing to do is just pay for it when you need it and save some cash in the meantime, right? Wrong \u2013 for a couple of reasons, starting with the lifetime community rating. \u201cOne thing that is important is that, a bit like a pension, it\u2019s best to \u2018start early\u2019,\u201d said Prendergast. \u201cIf you are a \u2018first timer\u2019 to health insurance from age 35 onwards, you will pay a lifetime community rating loading of 2 per cent for every year that you didn\u2019t hold health insurance over that age (ie six years x 2 per cent if you are 40). The loading applies for 10 years.\u201d That means those under 35 won\u2019t have to pay any of that pesky LCR. \u201cOnce you are in the health insurance \u2018club\u2019, you don\u2019t pay any more for your health insurance at 75 than you do at 45, due to Lifetime Community Rating,\u201d she said. This is where entry level plans can act as \u201ca stepping stone\u201d, according to Goode. \u201cEntry-level plans when people can only afford the bar minimum can help you get on the ladder to avoid age loadings and get waiting periods for pre-existing conditions out of the way.\u201d Be wary about staying on these too long, however, as this is a \u201cbig mistake\u201d. Any upgrade in hospital cover will see a two-year waiting period before the benefit can be used, Goode said. This could be an issue particularly for those now needing fertility or maternity benefits as their ages and lives change. Those who bought cheap plans in 2015 to avoid the loading stayed at the same level but, now, \u201ceight years later on, those entry levels plans could see that policy increased to \u20ac950,\u201d according to Goode. \u201cThose people think they\u2019re staying on the cheapest plan but they don\u2019t realise insurance companies launch new plans every year that could be cheaper. For example, Irish Life has a basic product for just over \u20ac460 so they wouldn\u2019t even have the cheapest plan any more but they\u2019re paying more for less benefits.\u201d [\u00a0 Moving to Australia? Here\u2019s how to make your finances work \u00a0] [\u00a0 Brianna Parkins: How to go about financing the purchase of your fixer-upper \u00a0] It doesn\u2019t pay to be loyal It doesn\u2019t pay to be loyal Insurance companies are required to treat all customers the same when it comes to policy prices regardless of medical history, age or years they\u2019ve held insurance. Usually, only groups such as companies with an employee scheme can access up to 10 per cent of a loyalty discount. This means it pays to shop around and to compare policies using the free tool available on the HIA  website  or a paid service like  irishhealthbroker.ie , which charges \u20ac150 for individual and family cover assessments. Worried that switching to a similar plan that\u2019s cheaper might mean resetting waiting periods? You shouldn\u2019t, according to Prendergast. \u201cOnce you serve these waiting periods, you will not have to serve them again if you switch to another insurer or another policy, as long as you haven\u2019t had a break in cover of more than 13 weeks.\u201d Switching to a plan with higher coverage could see waiting times kick up to a maximum of two years in some cases, however. \u201cIt might seem very daunting, as there are over 300 plans, but the majority of people \u2013 over half of those holding health insurance \u2013 are on one of 27 plans and 32 per cent on just 15 plans, the five most popular plans with each insurer,\u201d she said. So, good luck out there finding the perfect plan. Let\u2019s just hope you\u2019ll never have to use the most serious parts of it.",

            "raw_text": "The Quinn Insurance administrators received \u20ac375 per hour over 10 years for their work, say court filings setting out millions of euro in professional fees racked up in the running of the failed business. The High Court appointed two Grant Thornton partners in 2010 to oversee the insurer established by bankrupt businessman Se\u00e1n Quinn, which is soon to be wound down at an overall cost to the State of some \u20ac1 billion. In a final report to the court in recent weeks, Grant Thornton said the firm had received more than \u20ac1.19 million between July 2022 and March 2023 for work led by administrators Michael McAteer and Paul McCann. A further amount of \u20ac384,461 had also been incurred at that time. In addition, \u20ac60,509 was to be paid on account before the company\u2019s liquidation begins for \u201cexternal auditor fees, non-executive director fees and other minor disbursements, final tax fees and the administration team\u2019s time required to close out the administration and commence the liquidation\u201d.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 The accountants\u2019 hourly fees \u2013 set in 2012 \u2013 were levied at rates including \u20ac375 for partners in the firm, \u20ac290 for directors, \u20ac265 for senior managers, \u20ac165 for managers and \u20ac110 for assistant managers. Legal firm Maples & Calder charged \u20ac3.3 million last year in the three months between July and September for work on a \u20ac900 million claim for negligent auditing the administrators had taken against former Quinn Insurance auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). That action was settled in June 2022 at a cost of \u20ac54 million to PwC, \u201cinclusive of [Quinn Insurance] costs\u201d. Maples & Calder\u2019s payments in the third quarter of 2022 included \u20ac2.71 million for \u201ccounsels\u2019 fee\u201d to unnamed barristers and VAT. The legal firm received a further \u20ac126,372 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Maples did not respond to phone queries or emailed questions. Solicitors McCann FitzGerald received \u20ac17,705 including VAT in the fourth quarter of 2022 for work on the administration. The administrators incurred further fees of \u20ac22,020 with that firm between January and March, with an additional \u20ac7,000 to be paid for administrators\u2019 legal fees before the liquidation and \u20ac14,298 for counsel\u2019s fees. Grant Thornton declined to comment, saying fees and the PwC settlement were subject to \u201cclient confidentiality\u201d. The administrators\u2019 \u201c23rd and final report\u201d of March 21st was provided by to The Irish Times by the High Court. The document was opened in court in a March hearing to approve the final winding up of the insurer. The value of the PwC settlement was \u201cin line with\u201d an updated joint opinion by counsel presented on a confidential basis to the court in January 2022, the report said. That reflected consistent advice that \u201csignificant discounts\u201d had to be applied to the high headline claim. The report cited uncertainties generally in any litigation and \u201cthe varied, multiple and likely significant acts of contributory negligence of [Quinn Insurance], its directors and third parties\u201d. The report said the PwC proceedings would soon have entered the discovery phase, involving a \u201cprojected universe\u201d of about 150 million documents.",

            "raw_text": "Arachas, the largest Irish insurance broker, has agreed to buy third-generation family-owned Glennon Insurances in Dublin as consolidation in the broker market continues at pace. Industry sources put the value of the deal at more than \u20ac90 million. Glennon Insurances, which has been in operation for 75 years, has commercial clients across the construction, medical, retail, professional services, real estate and professional affinity group sectors as well as a business in private home and motor insurance. It is currently placing about \u20ac80 million of gross written premiums with insurers annually. The company, chaired by David Glennon, grandson of the firm\u2019s founder, has more than 100 employees. The deal, subject to regulatory approval, will grow Arachas\u2019s headcount in Ireland to more than 600. A spokesman for Arachas declined to comment on the value of the deal. \u201cWith many potential buyers approaching us, Arachas stood out as a partner who shares our family business values and our approach to listening to our clients so that we can find the best way to protect what matters most to them,\u201d said John Bissett, chief executive of Glennon Insurances. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Arachas, one of the most active dealmakers in the industry in the Republic, was itself acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a UK brokerage group that is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Partners, for \u20ac250 million. Arachas is led by chief executive Connor Brennan. At the time of the Ardonagh purchase, Arachas had set its sights of doubling within five years the \u20ac270 million of annual gross premiums it was writing for everything from plumbers to sporting organisations. The Glennon transaction, coupled with last year\u2019s purchase of Waterford-based Hooper Dolan has helped Arachas to achieve that target ahead of schedule. The deal comes less than two months after global insurance giant Arthur J Gallagher announced its arrival in the Irish market with the acquisition of MML Capital Partners-backed insurance group Innovu. Elsewhere, PIB Group, a UK intermediary that entered the Irish market in 2017 and went on to buy Campion Insurance last year, moved in May to buy Limerick-based Sullivan Insurances. The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. A Central Bank of Ireland report published in May on employers\u2019 and public liability and commercial property insurance showed that broker commissions across these three lines of coverage \u2013 usually sold as a package \u2013 equated to 16 per cent of insurance underwriters\u2019 gross earned premiums in 2019 and 2020.",

            "author": "Brianna Parkins",
            "date": "2023-11-08",
            "raw_text": "People don\u2019t usually get pets because they hate animals. Unless they are a working animal to serve a purpose, we get them to cuddle, pat, walk and spoil. Their only job is to love and be loved. As well as acting as the occasional scapegoat to blame bad smells on, deflecting judgment away from ourselves. For many they become part of the family and in some cases are even preferred. In Ireland, we seem to have particular gr\u00e1 for minding furry, fluffy or fishy friends. According to 2021 CSO research, 52 per cent of respondents said they lived with a pet with one in five acquiring their animal during the pandemic. Of those who had pets 87 per cent of those said their companion had \u201ca positive impact on their mental health and wellbeing.\u201d This is nothing new to anyone who\u2019s ever had a wagging tail greet them at the end of a long and frustrating work day. We know pets can improve our health but what about when it comes to taking care of theirs? According to a 2023 Petmania survey of 1600 owners, one-third of us love our animals enough to let them share our beds and another third let them sleep inside. But only thirty per cent of respondents had some form of pet insurance. The same research said owners can spend upwards of \u20ac2,000 a year maintaining their animals but an illness or an injury could push that figure up in worst-case scenarios. According to provider  Petinsurance.ie , their claim values for last year averaged \u20ac431 for illness and \u20ac623 for injury but said medical treatment costs could rise depending on the circumstances of each case. \u201cFor example, surgery to treat cruciate disease, a common complaint which affects dogs as they age, for the uninsured pet, could end up costing as much as \u20ac2,700 per leg, \u201c a spokesperson said. \u201cWith Premier Plus premiums from \u20ac13.89 per month (online price based on a 2-year-old IrishTerrier), pet insurance is something that owners simply cannot afford to be without.\u201d But with the ongoing cost of living crisis where people find themselves having to go without a lot of things, that \u20ac13.89 a month, every month for a dog who could live 11 to 13 more years on average is unaffordable. Adding another monthly outgoing at a time when things are being cut from stretched household budgets instead of being added on is a big ask. If we\u2019re feeding the kids unbranded cereals and cutting out takeaways for ourselves, forking over cash on a creature who chases its tail might seem a step too far for some. After all, just over half of us don\u2019t have private health insurance for ourselves, never mind the cat. According to  Petinsurance.ie , Ireland\u2019s pet insurance rate is \u201crelatively low compared to other countries.\u201d A 2017 study from the Irish Vet Journal found less than 10 per cent of pets in Ireland were insured at that time. While it\u2019s thought those rates have risen, compared to Sweden which Petinsurance.ie says has close to 70 per cent of pets insured, Ireland\u2019s take-up rates remain low. A spokesperson for Petinsurance.ie said this could be down to pet insurance being \u201cnot as well-known or widely advertised in Ireland\u201d as it is elsewhere. \u201cThe insurance market for pets is also smaller in Ireland, with fewer pet insurance brands available to choose from,\u201d they said. Most people want to know if pet insurance is worth it. But given the multitude of factors including breed, the chance of getting hurt and the financial circumstances of individuals there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. Are you willing to pay whatever it costs to treat your animal if it has an accident? Can you spare a few hundred out of the agency fund if you need to instead of relying on credit cards? Do you have a particular breed prone to medical conditions? Pete Wedderburn, veterinary surgeon and broadcaster says often the first thing a vet will ask when a sick or injured pet is brought is \u201cdo you have pet insurance?\u201d Wedderburn says people can get the wrong idea that the vet\u2019s main concern is \u201cmaking more money for the vet.\u201d But actually, this question is the vet seeking to understand what to do next. [\u00a0 Brianna Parkins: At my lowest, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house if I wasn\u2019t \u2018presentable\u2019 because \u2018what if someone saw?\u2019 \u00a0] \u201cThe vet needs to know whether to have a conversation about costs and options or can they just get on with doing everything they can do,\u201d he said. Wedderburn says gold standard pet care is \u201cwhen everything is done regardless of the cost to make sure every base is covered\u201d when treating an animal. \u201cIt\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s the ideal but no doubt it\u2019s also expensive,\u201d he said. While \u201cvets prefer\u201d to do everything they can, says Wedderburn, it\u2019s ultimately up to the owner\u2019s willingness and/or ability to pay for it. Sometimes the best care option isn\u2019t feasible for the client. Which is when vets turn to talking to owners about \u2018pragmatic\u2019 or \u2018what can be done\u2019 types of care options. \u201cGold standard has got to the stage where it is so expensive\u201d says Wedderburn, that vets have to ask about insurance early on to determine care. Wedderburn says it is \u201cincredibly upsetting\u201d to put any animal down and while some offer payment plans, many don\u2019t as a result of being burned. \u201cPeople think vets seem uncaring because they talk about money at the early stage but the reason for that is most if not all vets have had a client who has promised the earth and then just bailed on the vet and left them carrying the costs,\u201d he said. Costs which, like almost everything else lately, have risen. [\u00a0 Brianna Parkins on true crime podcasts: Who gets to tell the stories? \u00a0] Wedderburn says his clinic\u2019s fees \u201cstayed static for over a decade until last year\u201d when they found \u201ceverything went up\u201d including the costs of drugs, utilities and staff wages. Prices increased by \u201cmax ten per cent\u201d to keep the business viable but Wedderburn says the main issue for vet bills increasing is the increased technology available and people\u2019s attitudes changing. \u201cA lot more can be done for pets now than in the past because in general people are more emotionally involved with their pets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as part of the family and they often want to go that extra mile and they\u2019ll often go for almost a human standard of vet care.\u201d In some cases that can look like opting to take a dog to the UK to receive radiation treatment for brain tumours or getting injections of a special protein-seeking vaccine that reduces joint inflammation to keep an elderly pet pain-free at a cost of over \u20ac100 a month. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking it will be an accident or one-off injury that could leave you most out of pocket as a pet owner says Wedderburn. \u201cPeople often think about the big things about broken legs but it\u2019s chronic diseases like itchy skin and arthritis that are often more expensive because repeated treatments are needed.\u201d If you do decide that coughing up a monthly fee for something you hope you won\u2019t use is preferable to the chance you\u2019ll have to make emotional financial decisions at the vet it\u2019s important to remember the two rules about buying any kind of insurance. Always shop around and the devil is in the detail. There are three main types of coverage to choose from, said Emma Archer of  Switcher.ie . The first is \u2018accident only\u2019 which \u201coften the cheapest policy available, covers any treatment a pet may need after an accident\u201d but not any other illness. \u201cTime-limited\u201d cover \u201cprotects your pet for 12 months\u201d but no conditions after that. Then there\u2019s lifetime cover where the \u201c insurer does not limit either the amount you can claim or the length of time you can claim for a specific condition.\u201d However, even if they opt for lifetime cover, owners of older dogs or dogs with pre-existing conditions need to be aware that they may be excluded from policies. For example, Allianz pet insurance states on their website that pets must be younger than eight years old and illness and/or injuries sustained before the policy was taken out won\u2019t be covered. Unlike human health insurance, the price of pet insurance premiums can also rise year to year based on the claims made. \u201cIn the event of illness or injury, if your vet bill is relatively small, consider whether it is worth claiming because there will be an \u2018excess\u2019 to pay, and some insurers also charge an admin fee,\u201d said Archer. Another big factor determining premium prices is the breed of dog. According to Wedderburn, purebred dogs are usually the most expensive to insure over mongrels because of health problems associated with close breeding. For example, labradors often suffer from hip dysplasia and flat-faced breeds like french bulldogs often have breathing problems. According to Archer, most insurers will not cover the cost of \u201croutine and preventive treatments (eg vaccines), pre-existing illness or injury, like diabetes or arthritis, pregnancy and birth, dogs registered under the Dangerous Dogs Act or pets under eight weeks old including puppies and kittens.\u201d It\u2019s also more difficult to switch and save because unlike car and home insurance, pet insurance \u201cyear on year is more complex.\u201d \u201cPet insurance quotes are largely based on the age and health of your pet, so beating your renewal quote is less likely, especially with Lifetime cover,\u201d said Archer. But the good news premiums from the get-go can be reduced by taking simple steps. Insurers will offer discounts for pets that are microchipped and multiple pets under the same policy. It also pays to check whether your existing insurance offers incentives to \u2018bundle\u2019 pet insurance with your other policies. Some policies will incur an excess for bare-bones accident coverage while others include up to seven nights of boarding if you get too sick to look after your animal so it\u2019s always important to read the fine print if you do purchase insurance for your fur baby. Or keep an emergency fund for pet bills if you opt against it, because no one wants to make a tough money decision on the spot at the vet.",

            "raw_text": "Veterinary costs have started to bite as a new breed of dog owner that bought or adopted during Covid-19 complain they face rising bills for vet care. The price of veterinary care has become such an issue, there is now concern some pet owners who are unable to pay vet bills will surrender their dogs to charities instead of paying for their care. \u201cWe are seeing more and more cases of dogs being abandoned with extensive veterinary needs, and it has made us question if people cannot currently afford to look after their dogs?\u201d said Corina Fitzsimons, a spokeswoman for Dogs Trust Ireland. \u201cUnfortunately, we are then left to cover expensive medical costs which, in some cases, could have been easily treated when they initially arose.\u201d Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Almost one-third of households across the country own a dog and yet very few have pet insurance, with bills of up to \u20ac2,400 for an average \u201cexpensive\u201d vet trip, according to Allianz. Even without an emergency trip to the vet, the cost of routine visits, feeding and general care will cost the average dog owner roughly \u20ac1,200 per year. One long-term labrador breeder said their vet\u2019s bills had \u201ctrebled\u201d in the last three years and they had been told it was due to rising costs such as electricity and staff. The breeder did not wish to be named but said the price of puppies had also crashed from \u20ac2,000 a puppy at peak demand during the pandemic to \u20ac500. \u201cEven the cost of food has gone crazy. It\u2019s gone from \u20ac15 to \u20ac38 for the same bag of feed in just three years.\u201d During the pandemic, the number of people looking to buy or adopt dogs rose dramatically, with record-high prices being sought for puppies and charities finding demand for adoptions hard to keep up with. One of those new dog owners was Dublin-based Sandra Green, who adopted a retired greyhound called Otto, from a charity. Ms Green, who is a qualified doctor, had always wanted a pet dog and particularly wanted an older dog because they are often overlooked by families who usually prefer to adopt puppies. \u201cI was aware that Otto had health problems when we adopted him, he\u2019s always been shaky and wasn\u2019t expected to live very long. It was obvious he\u2019d had a tough life and gone through some form of abuse. We just wanted to give him the best care possible and make sure that he enjoyed the life he had left,\u201d she said. However, Otto has defied the odds and is still going strong three years after his adoption. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that he\u2019s still part of the family and he loves going for little walks every day on the beach, but he is definitely getting stiffer and his eyesight has almost completely gone.\u201d Sandra has chosen to manage Otto\u2019s pain with pain relief from the vet and a special diet for older dogs with digestion problems. It\u2019s an added monthly expense but it could be even more expensive if she were to seek an operation for Otto\u2019s cataracts and other issues. She feels however, it wouldn\u2019t be realistic given his age and infirmity as well as the veterinary costs involved, but she will continue to pay for his pain relief and give him a comfortable life in her home where he has become a valued member of the family. However, some other people who adopted dogs during the pandemic have come to regret their decision. Statistics from the Department of Rural and Community Development show there were 7,352 stray or unwanted dogs in 2022, an increase from 4,165 in 2021. Their report also found 5,045 strays entered pounds, 2,064 of which were surrendered and 243 were seized. According to the Chief Executive of Veterinary Ireland, Finnbar Murphy, the most common reasons why owners surrender their pets is due to behavioural problems and time constraints. \u201cMany local authority pounds are full to overflowing,\u201d he told a Joint Oireachtas Agriculture Committee earlier this month. However, he went on to state that medical reasons for surrendering pets was cited by owners as a \u201cminor cause\u201d. This was challenged by Sinn F\u00e9in senator Lynn Boylan who recently paid \u20ac2,500 in vet bills for her dog. She wanted to know why she and other pet owners weren\u2019t afforded a transparent comparison of vets fees nationwide. Dr Green, the owner of Otto, found a geographic element when it came to veterinary costs. Her greyhound receives steroid injections on a regular basis that cost \u20ac60 each in Dublin but the same injection cost just \u20ac15 in Tralee when they were on a trip to Kerry this year. Dr Bill Cashman, who is well known within the veterinary community, and was representing the Veterinary Ireland Companion Animal Society at the Oireachtas committee, defended veterinary costs, and pointed out that vets and their practices had been hit by inflation and rising costs, including electricity, just like other companies and households around the country. He said most veterinary practices had facilities that were a cross between a GP and an emergency room and all vets were under an obligation to make clients aware of the cost of treating their animals before any treatment took place. \u201cThere has to be some dawning reality that we can\u2019t cut costs down to zero,\u201d he told the committee. Last year, the Veterinary Council of Ireland (VCI) received 36 complaints in relation to vets but just six were in relation to failing to inform an owner of the cost associated with the care of an animal. The majority of the complaints \u2013 some 27 \u2013 were concerning a single vet. Overall, complaints to the veterinary oversight body were down 80 per cent. However, across the Irish Sea, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in England has launched a review into soaring costs and a potential lack of competition in the marketplace. Pet ownership in England is higher than in Ireland and the veterinary services market there is worth \u00a32 billion, with a higher focus on corporate-owned veterinary practices. In Ireland, the majority of practices are owned privately by vets themselves and not large-scale companies, but there are growing concerns in Ireland that a more commercial mindset is taking root as more corporate practices enter the marketplace here. This is part of the reason Fianna F\u00e1il TD Jackie Cahill has been pushing for a bill to be passed into legislation which would mean only a qualified vet could own and run a practice. Concerns have arisen elsewhere too. The Federal Trade Commission in the United States forced consolidator National Veterinary Associates to offload a number of assets due to competition concerns and in France, a court maintained that veterinary practices could only be controlled by vets.

            "author": "Fiona Reddan",
            "date": "2022-08-23",
            "raw_text": "With the rising cost of living on the minds of many, cutting expenses this autumn and winter will be firmly on the to-do list. While health insurance is a considerable expense for many Irish families (almost one in two pay for such cover), it can be tricky to save money on given the breadth of policies and options available \u2014 325 at the last count, according to the Health Insurance Authority (HIA). Moreover, there is also an element of anxiety attached to switching policies: what if you inadvertently give up on cover that you might need down the line? However, there can be a simpler approach. Some of the aforementioned 300-plus policies are now out of date, and while the cover they offer may be appealing, the cost of the policies are not. According to Dermot Goode of Total Health Cover, the people most at risk of being on an out-of-date plan include those who have been on the same plan for five years or more; people who are paying more than \u20ac1,900 per adult; or those who are not getting guaranteed refunds on outpatient expenses. \u201cThe odds are you\u2019re overpaying for cover and missing out on better deals. You\u2019ve nothing to lose by shopping around to see if any better deals exist, and often you can find these deals with your existing insurer,\u201d he advises. Indeed, you could be looking at savings of some \u20ac500-\u20ac1,000 a year if you were to switch from such a plan, while Goode notes that, in some cases, you will also achieve a higher level of cover as well as a lower premium. Older customers Many of those stuck on such plans will likely be older people. Last year, a report from the HIA found that people over 65 years pay an average 44 per cent more for their health insurance. While someone aged under 65 pays an average of \u20ac1,365 a year for their cover, someone aged 65 or over will pay \u20ac1,971 a year for their cover, or \u20ac606 more. While some of this may be down to the level of cover they opt for \u2014 for example, people under 65 years old are more likely to have plans with restricted orthopaedic cover \u2014 it might also be because they haven\u2019t switched at any time in the recent past. The survey offers a further insight into why this might be. When asked, for example, about past and future changes to their health insurance policies, people aged 55 and older are more likely to maintain the same level of cover over time. Indeed, 68 per cent said they would keep their level of cover the same, compared with just 36 per cent of those aged between 18 and 34, while just 14 per cent of over-55s said they would look to take out a cheaper plan with the same benefits. As noted by Goode, however, maintaining your cover doesn\u2019t always mean that you have to continue paying the same price; switching can cut costs.

Unsurprisingly then, many opted for Plan B, which, at the time, was one of the most popular plans on the market. However, these plans have since been updated several times by the insurer, which means that many older customers may be languishing on out-of-date plans. For example, those on the old Plan B (VHI HealthPlus Access) are likely overpaying for their policy, says Goode, as this now costs \u20ac2,123 per adult per year. Similarly, the old Plan B Option plan has been replaced by VHI HealthPlus Extra, but again, this comes in at a hefty \u20ac2,740 per adult. Another expensive option is the AdvancedCare Extra Day-to-Day, which comes in at \u20ac2,965 per adult. Goode suggests that such policyholders could save as much as 50 per cent by swapping to a newer, more cost-effective policy. Provided that they are willing to take on a set shortfall on a small number of listed orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures, policyholders can avail of options including a corporate scheme such as PMI 36 13 at \u20ac1,339 per adult, or Company Plan Extra Level 1 \u2014 private room plan, which comes in at \u20ac1,760 per adult. Alternatively, there are also savings to be made by swapping to VHI\u2019s HealthPlus Excess or the new AdvancedCare 50 Day-to-Day schemes, both costing \u20ac2,016 per adult. Laya Health It\u2019s a similar story at Laya Health, with many members remaining on outdated plans. As with the VHI and its Plan B policy, Laya\u2019s Essential Plus (Excess) scheme was a popular policy when introduced; however, as Goode notes, it has been on the market for more than 20 years and now costs \u20ac3,084 per adult per year. Time for a change, then. Similarly, other outdated \u2014 and expensive considering the benefits on offer \u2014 plans include Complete Simplicity (which costs \u20ac2,045 per adult); Flex 125 Plus (\u20ac2,280); and Total Health Select (\u20ac2,494). But what are the options for similar benefits at a lower cost? Well, members could consider Simply Connect Plus at \u20ac1,471 (which is a semi-private corporate plan); of Simplicity at \u20ac1,535 per adult (which is a private room scheme). Another option is the new Momentum scheme, which offers private room cover with decent outpatient refunds and full cover for listed orthopaedic surgeries. This costs \u20ac1,825 per member. Irish Life Health This insurer, which is now part of Canada\u2019s Great-West Lifeco, entered the health insurance market in 2016 when it upped its stake in GloHealth to 100 per cent, and also acquired Aviva Health. Given that customers of these two insurers will have simply had their policies transferred over to Irish Life at the time, it means that some may now be paying over the odds on their outdated plans. For example, plans such as Level 2 Hospital Excess (\u20ac2,657 per adult); Business Plan Complete (\u20ac3,262 per adult); Better ILH (\u20ac1,990 per adult) and Level 2 Family Health (\u20ac2,657 per adult) may offer decent cover \u2014 but not necessarily decent value. Instead, customers should consider the latest corporate plans, says Goode, such as the 4D Health 2 semi-private plan at \u20ac1,351 per adult or the 4D Health 4 private room scheme at \u20ac1,637 per adult. How to make the switching procedure painless If you find yourself on one of the out-of-date plans mentioned in this article, you may be of a mind to switch. While the best savings for you may be achieved by switching to a different insurer entirely (check out  hia.ie  for comparisons), many private health insurance members can be nervous of doing so. It\u2019s important to remember that legislation ensures that you won\u2019t lose out in terms of having to endure waiting periods etc, when switching to a new provider. As a spokeswoman for the HIA notes: \u201cThe same rules will apply when switching insurers or switching within the same company.\u201d This means that your cover will remain as it is \u2014 so existing conditions etc will be covered with the new insurer. The only issue that can arise is if you are upgrading your cover. The relevant rules mean that if you switch to a plan which offers higher benefits, you\u2019ll have to wait up to two years before you can access these new benefits, while maternity benefits have a 52-week waiting period. However, not all insurers apply the maximum rule. With the VHI, for example, there is no waiting period if you upgrade your outpatient benefits. Inpatient with pre-existing conditions will have a two-year wait, while day-to-day expenses upgrade has a waiting period of 26 weeks for those aged 50 and over. As with VHI, there is no waiting period on outpatient benefits at Irish Life, but a 26-week delay on day-to-day expenses for those aged 55 and over, and a two-year wait for those with pre-existing conditions. At Laya, you can also benefit from higher outpatient services immediately, but must wait two years for inpatient services for pre-existing conditions. Remember that you\u2019ll still benefit from the existing cover you had before the upgrade while you wait for full cover. So, for example, if you increase orthopaedic cover from 80 per cent to full cover, you will still have your current cover of 80 per cent for the two-year waiting period. When making the switch you\u2019ll also need to time your move. Health insurance contracts typically run over a 12-month period, which means that you\u2019re most likely to switch when you get your renewal notice. However, if you want to switch before this, it may be possible to do so, and means you can start saving earlier. Both Laya and Irish Life, for example, allow customers to switch to another of their plans midterm, with no financial penalty for doing so. So a simple phone call today to switch to another plan with your current provider could save you hundred of euro. According to a spokeswoman for the VHI, the insurer does not allow customers to make changes until the renewal date; however, it will allow a midterm cover change where the customer outlines a medical need for additional cover/access to higher benefits. This is available on 90 per cent of its plans, and means that customers can start serving their waiting periods earlier than they might otherwise have done so. There is no charge for this. If you want to switch to another insurer midterm, however, there may be limited financial incentive to do so, as insurers will apply cancellation charges. Laya, for example, will charge you the full year\u2019s premium, while Irish Life will impose a cancellation charge (health insurance levy, \u20ac449, on a pro-rata basis for the rest of the policy plus a fee of \u20ac25). VHI will charge you charge the health insurance levy (\u20ac449) on a pro-rata basis for the rest of the policy plus a fee of \u20ac50.",

            "date": "2021-01-14",
            "raw_text": "The High Court has deferred delivering its judgment in four important test cases brought by pub owners over Insurer FBD's refusal to pay out on business disruption over the Covid-19 pandemic. The delay is to allow the parties' lawyers to make further legal submissions to the court arising out of a judgment in a case where similar issues were raised which is due to be given on Friday by the UK's Supreme Court. Mr Justice Denis McDonald was also due to give his judgment in the action against the FBD on Friday. In order to allow the sides to make submissions on the UK court\u2019s findings, the judge said he was putting back his decision. He said he hopes to deliver his judgment in early February. Four publicans have brought cases challenging FBD Insurance plc\u2019s refusal earlier this year to indemnify them, and the insurer\u2019s stance that its policies of insurance do not cover the disruption caused to businesses by Covid-19. More than 1,000 Irish pubs and bars are affected by the dispute which arose after the insurer refused to provide them with cover since the pandemic resulted in the temporary closure of businesses in mid-March 2020. On Thursday, Mr Justice Denis McDonald was asked by FBD\u2019s lawyers to delay delivering his judgment to allow submissions to be made on the UK appeal. That appeal relates to the English High Court\u2019s ruling in a case where that court was asked to determine if the pandemic should trigger pay-outs to holders of business interruption insurance policies. The English High Court found in favour of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) , which brought the case on behalf of the policyholders, on the majority of the key issues. The UK court ruled that pay-outs were triggered under certain \u201cnon-damage\u201d clauses that covered disease and denial of access to business premises. That decision was appealed to the UK\u2019s Supreme Court. Seeking the deferral, Caren Geoghegan BL for FBD said the UK case was heavily relied upon by the plaintiffs during the three-week hearing. The fairest and most efficient thing to do would be to adjourn the delivery of the judgment in the Irish action to allow the sides make submissions on the British court\u2019s findings, counsel submitted. Proceed as planned Lawyers for the publicans said their preference was for Mr Justice McDonald to proceed to judgment as planned, but they would make written submissions only on the English court\u2019s decision if required. Eoin McCullough SC for one of the pub owners, Sean\u2019s Bar in Athlone, said his client was concerned about any further delay in the case. In his ruling, Mr Justice McDonald said that his judgment was done, and was ready to go, but he was prepared to defer giving his decision. While not indicating in any way what his decision is, he did say that he had done his own thing and had not fundamentally relied on the English court\u2019s findings. While not wanting to delay judgment any further, the judge said this was \u201can unusual situation,\u201d and that in any event further submissions on certain discrete issues would be required. He said he was keen to hear from the parties what they say are the implications of the UK judgement on the issues that were argued before him. He directed that submissions be prepared and exchanged between the parties, and that he would give judgment on February 5th. The tests cases were brought by four pubs arising out of FBD\u2019s refusal to indemnify them for the disruption to their businesses due to Covid-19. The actions have been taken by Dublin bars Aberken, trading as Sinnotts Bar; Hyper Trust Ltd, trading as The Leopardstown Inn and Inn on Hibernian Way Ltd trading as Lemon & Duke. The fourth action was taken by Leinster Overview Concepts Ltd, the owner of Sean's Bar, which is based in Athlone. Each of the pub owners claim that under their policies of insurance taken out with FBD they are entitled to have their consequential losses covered by what they claim is an insurable risk. They also claim that by failing to pay out on the policy the insurer is in breach of contract. Publicans\u2019 case The publicans claim the policies taken out with FBD contain a clause that states the pubs will be indemnified if their premises are closed by order of the local or Government Authority if there are \u201cOutbreaks of contagious or infectious diseases on the premises or within 25 miles of same\u201d. FBD disputes that claim and says the closures did not occur as a result of an outbreak of disease at the premises or areas where the pubs are located. FBD also told the court that it has never provided cover for pandemics and no one in Ireland has ever asked for it. The general insurance market in Ireland does not insure against events like pandemics, it claims. Only specialist brokers, which he said are based overseas, on a bespoke basis offer an insurance policy that cover the fall-out from something like Covid-19, FBD also argued",

            "raw_text": "Anyone hoping for a big reduction in their insurance premiums following last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision should not hold their breath. This includes solicitor and senior counsel Stuart Gilhooly, the Law Society\u2019s representative on the personal injuries commission which led to the Personal Injuries Guidelines that the  Supreme Court has ruled are constitutional and legally binding . The guidelines \u2014 introduced in March 2021 \u2014 stipulate awards that are significantly below the level of the awards under the book of quantum used previously. Gilhooly was of the view that the court\u2019s decision removed \u201cthe last remaining excuse for the insurance industry for not reducing premiums \u2013 it\u2019s time for the insurers to put up or shut up\u201d, he said. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 His optimism is welcome, but he probably hadn\u2019t read the  statement issued by Moyagh Murdock , chief executive of Insurance Ireland, in the wake of the decision. The lobby group which represents Irish insurance companies said the decision was \u201ca very welcome outcome for consumers with the veracity of the Personal Injuries Guidelines upheld, which has been the most important piece of the Government\u2019s insurance reform agenda in seeking to bring down the high cost of personal injury awards in Ireland\u201d. It\u2019s the last bit that is important. The objective of the exercise \u2014 in the opinion of the Insurance Ireland \u2014 is to reduce the size of awards. It is not to reduce premiums. The two may be related, but they are not the same thing. Insurance companies exist for one reason and one reason to only; to make money for the people who own them. They are not a public good. If something happens that drastically improves their bottom line there is no legal obligation on them to pass these savings on to their customers via lower premiums. Some might argue their obligation is actually to return as much of the windfall to shareholders as possible. In theory, competition from rivals will give them an incentive to cut premiums if they can, but that is not always the case. And that is when the Government is supposed to step in. [\u00a0 Supreme Court finds that guidelines slashing personal injury awards has legal effect \u2018of systemic importance\u2019 \u00a0] Insurance Ireland promised to \u201cconsider the findings in depth over the coming days\u201d and that it was \u201cis too early in the process to see the full impact of today\u2019s judgment\u201d. This can be roughly translated as: give us a moment while we think of some other reason why your premiums are not going to come down any time soon. And they won\u2019t have to look to far to find one. Every year the Central Bank of Ireland \u2014 that regulates insurance companies \u2014 publishes two reports based on its database of insurance claims. One looks at motor insurance and the other looks at employer\u2019s liability, public liability, and commercial property insurance. Between them they cover the bulk of personal injury claims. The reports for 2022 have just been published. Helpfully, they contain sections looking in detail at the impact of the personal injuries guidelines on claims costs. They found substantial reductions in the costs of settling claims under the guidelines, compared to similar claims that were settled before their introduction. In the case of employers\u2019 liability, the reductions ranged from 17 per cent to 33 per cent depending on the route used to settle the claim, and in the case of public liability, they ranged from 33 per cent to 41 per cent. It is a similar pattern when it comes to motor insurance. Claims settled under the guidelines are between 32 per cent and 47 per cent less than claims settled under the book of quantum. The bad news is that these only relate to cases settled either before, during or after engagement with the Injuries Resolution Board (formally Piab) which was set up by the Government as a lower cost alternative to settling claims via the courts. Most cases are still settled via the courts, and according to the central bank, it will take time for the guidelines to have an impact on court settlements. This is because the guidelines only apply to cases that commence after their introduction in 2021, and many of the cases before the courts predate their introduction. [\u00a0 Clarification of legal status of personal injury guidelines turns spotlight on insurers \u00a0] Personal injury claims going through the courts take an average of five years to settle, which means that it could be another two or three years if not longer for cases that are not subject to the guidelines to wash out of the system. Consequently, while the impact of the Personal Injuries Guidelines on claims settled directly and via Piab is significant, they have not yet had a marked impact on the overall claims settlement cost, say the central bank. What is not clear is whether last week\u2019s court ruling changes any of this. There does not seem to be any good reason why insurance companies cannot use the certainty brought by the decision to start reducing premiums. They now have a pretty clear picture of the number of outstanding claims that will be settled under the guidelines, and the ones that will be settled under the book of quantum over the next few years. This should let them smooth premiums over the transition to the point in time when substantially all claims will be settled under the guidelines at significantly lower cost. But why would they want to do that if they don\u2019t have to?

Thomas Doyle made a complaint against insurance broker company XS Direct Insurance Brokers Limited, which, at the time of the decision by the WRC, was in receivership. Mr Doyle made his complaint to the WRC on November 15th, 2021, relating to his entitlement to annual bonuses, through reaching two sets of targets during 2019 and 2020, which were not paid to him. Each annual bonus was worth \u20ac22,155. Mr Doyle said that the respondent, XS Direct Insurance Ltd, told him that he would be paid these bonuses but received neither.

In his decision published on Tuesday, adjudicating officer Kevin Baneham agreed that Mr Doyle\u2019s complaint was \u201cwell-founded\u201d and awarded him, under section 6 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, \u20ac60,926. \u2018Salary reduction\u2019 Mr Baneham said: \u201cI ensured that the parties were on notice of the time, date and venue of the hearing.

It was only later that the complainant was told he would not be paid his wages. The monies, however, were never paid.

            "raw_text": "First there was the VHI, a solid, State-owned operator that stood alone offering five levels of private health insurance cover that ran the gamut from A to E. Then, in the 1990s along came Bupa, which quickly morphed into Quinn Healthcare (owned by Se\u00e1n Quinn), which in turn turned into Laya Healthcare. Then Vivas arrived, which was later acquired by Aviva, which itself exited the market in 2016 with Irish Life buying the unit, while at the same time taking out the 51 per cent of another provider, GloHealth, that it did not already own. They were merged to become Irish Life Health. Aviva has now announced plans to re-enter the market less than a decade after it upped sticks, and it will be guided through the choppy waters of Irish health insurance via a joint venture with old hands including Oliver Tatten (formerly of VHI, Vivas and Glo Health) and Jim Dowdall (who was most recently the boss of Irish Life Health), as well as health entrepreneur Stephen Loughman. Confused? You\u2019re not alone. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to compare Ireland\u2019s private health insurance market to a particularly convoluted and long-running game of musical chairs, albeit with a lot of money on the table for the winners. The return of Aviva took the market by surprise and, although there had been whispers of some new entrant coming to the table, few expected it to be an old player. \u201cNobody saw this one coming,\u201d says Dermot Goode of broker totalhealthcover.ie. \u201cWe heard a rumour a couple of weeks back about a new entrant but we actually thought it was somebody else, a completely different insurer.\u201d It has to be good news for consumers whether you\u2019re a family or an individual or an employer \u2014 Dermot Goode The new venture is set to start selling private health insurance in the second half of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals,  Aviva  said in a statement released last week. It still requires Central Bank of Ireland authorisation. \u201cAviva is delighted to support the set-up of an exciting new health insurance business in Ireland. This is great news for Irish consumers, as it will provide greater choice and value,\u201d its chief executive, Declan O\u2019Rourke, said. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) has been watching closely. It said it had been \u201ccontacted by a new insurer some time ago to discuss their intention to join the market\u201d and added that it would \u201cwork with any potential new market entrant along with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure full compliance with the relevant legislation. Our aim in all engagement is to deliver a competitive market, value for consumers and to give full consideration to future needs.\u201d In a somewhat terse statement in said it respected \u201cthe prospective new insurer\u2019s right to disclose further information in due course/at the appropriate time\u201d. The British insurer has returned to the Irish health insurance market not long after Axa, one of its main rivals on the global stage, took over Laya for \u20ac650 million. Axa\u2019s takeover of the State\u2019s second-largest provider will allow it to cross-promote its general insurance products with ease, and Aviva, no doubt mindful of that, might fancy a bit of that crossover action, too. The expectation, according to sources, is that Aviva will attack the retail market first, followed by corporates. \u201cIt has to be good news for consumers whether you\u2019re a family or an individual or an employer,\u201d says Goode. \u201cA new entrant like these guys will have to get scale very quickly. They have not acquired an existing player so they need to get a lot of members on board fairly fast, and they need to attract the right risks, and the only way to get that type of scale is to have a very aggressive pricing model that undercuts the existing providers and significantly undercuts them to get people to switch. The new provider will also have to offer very attractive benefits.\u201d [\u00a0 Will Aviva\u2019s return to the Irish health insurance market reduce premium prices? \u00a0] At the end of 2023, 2.48 million people had health insurance. VHI continues to have the largest market share and ended the year at 48.9 per cent, followed by Laya on 28 per cent and Irish Life Health on 20.5 per cent. The new entrant will have to get tens of thousands of customers fast, and in the absence of convincing people without insurance to sign up, it will have to take them from the three others on the market. Whatever about the challenges that will present, it is a challenging time for the existing health insurance providers, which are all facing a surge in claims in the post-pandemic period, as well as a spike in medical inflation. The  VHI\u2019s  annual results, published earlier this month, showed that it took in a healthy \u20ac1.68 billion in premiums for its private health insurance business, with its customer base increasing for the ninth year in a row. However, the results noted that in 2023, Ireland experienced \u201ca faster than anticipated recovery in demand for healthcare\u201d following years of restrictions in access and capacity associated with the pandemic. It saw \u201can unprecedented increase in the volume and cost of claims\u201d and paid out more than \u20ac1.68 billion, up 18 per cent on 2022. It recorded a net deficit or loss of \u20ac43.4 million last year compared with a net surplus or profit of \u20ac34.3 million in 2022. [\u00a0 Cost of health insurance jumped sharply last year - watchdog \u00a0] Times are also challenging for consumers, with the cost of health insurance for a family of four climbing by about \u20ac500 last year compared with 2022, according to the HIA. Its market report covering last year also showed that while nearly one in two Irish people have health insurance, the pace at which people are taking out cover has slowed since 2022. A total of 47 per cent of the population have health insurance, with that number increasing by just 1.6 per cent since 2022. The slowdown is, the HIA suggests, because of higher prices and the cost-of-living crisis. The average cost climbed by 10 per cent since 2022 to \u20ac1,594, with price increases throughout 2023 by all three health insurers. This suggests the Aviva comeback will meet headwinds. \u201cThe people involved in this new venture have been around with different insurers so they know the market very well,\u201d says Goode. \u201cI have no insight into their thinking but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve done their research and they obviously see an opportunity in the market. \u201cOn the face of it the market is difficult for any new entrant and it has always been a difficult market because you have to comply with minimum benefits you have to make your products available to everybody and you have to pay into the risk equalisation fund, so even if you\u2019re very successful in your strategy of attracting younger members, you\u2019re going to have to contribute more to the risk equalisation fund. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy market to make money in quickly. But these individuals have done this a number of times, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing focus groups and I\u2019m sure they know how many how many people they need, and I would say they have very clear targets and know what level of membership they need to achieve certain milestones.\u201d Goode says that although it \u201chas to be good news for consumers the devil will be in the detail\u201d. It is not speculation to say that older people already pay more despite the supposedly level playing field of the health insurance market Industry sources suggest it might not be the good news some believe it to be. \u201cSome of the people behind this have been here before,\u201d one said. \u201cThey come in, set up a business, hoover up the younger more profitable consumers and once they reach a certain number of members, they sell up. I am not sure who wins in that scenario other than those behind the companies.\u201d It seems certain that the new company will seek to attract a younger, healthier and more profitable cohort \u2013 to do anything else would be foolish \u2013 and it will have to make its plans attractive, but the nature of the health insurance market in Ireland is such that people cannot be penalised or excluded based on their age or any pre-existing condition, so any plan the new company rolls out will be open to all comers. \u201cYou can go out with an aggressive strategy to try and attract those younger, more profitable members but everything you launch will be available to every consumer,\u201d says Goode. \u201cYou can design plans that might be less attractive maybe to older members because you might put higher excesses on those plans and you might have co-payments for things like orthopaedics and cardiac and ophthalmic care, so you can design plans that are very structured and might be less attractive to certain segments but we can only speculate.\u201d It is not speculation to say that older people already pay more despite the supposedly level playing field of the health insurance market. HIA research shows that people over the age of 65 are paying 43 per cent more on average for health insurance, with the higher cost of orthopaedic and joint replacement cover one of the main reasons for the higher premiums. Two-thirds of the over-65s are on high orthopaedic cover compared with only 27 per cent of those under 65. Just under three-quarters of the under-65s are on restricted orthopaedic cover that would see them cover a portion of the bill should they require such care. The same report also notes that while there are 350 plans and three insurers in the health insurance market, half of all customers have signed up to fewer than 10 per cent of the plans on offer. The new arrival will mean there are more plans on the market \u2013 and not just from this company. \u201cThe other insurance companies are not going to sit on their hands,\u201d says Goode. \u201cThey can quickly copy new plans and only have to give one month notice to the health insurance authority, so aggressive competition is to be expected.\u201d And when will it happen? There are no hard and fast dates yet but the peak time for health insurance renewal is January and February, and once a person renews or signs up they are locked in for a 12-month period, so the new company will need to have all its ducks in a row and be out selling itself to Irish consumers by October at the very latest. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what their distribution model will be,\u201d says Goode. \u201cWill it be via brokers or online? There are a lot of questions at the moment but no answers although I\u2019m sure all those details will become obvious over the coming weeks and months. I have been saying for a long time this market could easily sustain five health insurance companies each with about half a million members. The fact that we only have three is not enough at all, so hopefully this will stir up competition and shake up the whole switcher market.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

            "raw_text": "Brexit has been blamed for a lot of woes this side of the Irish Sea \u2014 the latest being demise of the traditional thatched cottage. Minister of State with responsibility for Insurance Sean Fleming has warned a mass exodus of UK insurers from Ireland has \u201cabsolutely exacerbated\u201d the travails of the country\u2019s dwindling number of thatched property owners. For years, they relied on specialist underwriters in London \u2014 one of the biggest insurance markets in the world with a similar legal framework to here \u2014 who could \u201cpassport\u201d services into other EU countries. When that ended after the UK decided to pull out of the EU, it became \u201cmore expensive and more bureacratic\u201d for the specialist insurers to offer niche cover for homeowners in Ireland. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 \u201cI know people would say there were issues long before Brexit, but Brexit has absolutely exacerbated the problem,\u201d Mr Fleming told an Oireachtas committee hearing on insuring thatched properties. \u201cBecause most of the insurance was coming from the UK and since the UK decided to leave the EU, they can\u2019t sell from London into Ireland or any EU country anymore. We are left with a gap way worse than we had ever before Brexit happened.\u201d Minister of State with responsibility for heritage Malcolm Noonan told the committee there are only an estimated 2,000 thatched buildings remaining in Ireland. \u201cIt will be devastating if we lose any more of these,\u201d he said. His officials are carrying out a national survey to establish accurate figures for the number of thatched properties \u2014 both historic and modern \u2014 in every county as part of a departmental effort to boost ownership and conservation. Officials are also working on data from questionnaires recently returned by 497 thatched property owners \u2014 about one-quarter of all owners \u2014 concerning problems they face, including insurance, fire hazards and lessons from other countries. Results of the analysis are expected at the end of this month. Mr Noonan said in other countries thatched buildings are insured at \u201can affordable rate\u201d by commercial companies, which indicated \u201cthis is not an insoluble problem\u201d for Ireland. Early indications, he said, suggest reducing the incidents of fire outbreaks in thatched properties could significantly reduce the cost of insurance premiums. The committee was told fairly simple measures could help in reducing hazards. Mr Fleming said he also met international insurance companies who warned him the high cost of claims in Ireland \u2014 as well as \u201cexaggerated cases\u201d \u2014 was acting as a barrier to many offering cover. However, State investment agency IDA is working to attract up to 20 insurers from Europe and elsewhere overseas into the Irish market, he added.",

            "date": "2022-07-01",
            "raw_text": "Loyal customers of insurance companies who have been overcharged for years should start to see reductions in the cost of renewing premiums from Friday as a new regulations banning so-called \u201cprice-walking\u201d comes into force. The measure is part of broader efforts to reform the insurance sector being spearheaded by Minister of State at the Department of Finance Se\u00e1n Fleming. In an interview with The Irish Times, he rejected a claim by Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Pearse Doherty that government actions in the area were \u201ctoo often progressing at a snail\u2019s pace\u201d as the Fianna F\u00e1il TD outlined a series of measures designed to cut insurance costs for households and businesses. This includes legislation on rebalancing the duty of care between a premises owner with personal responsibility of members of the public, which will be debated in the D\u00e1il on Friday. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Mr Fleming said the \u201conly hold-up\u201d to savings already being made by insurance companies due to reduced personal injury awards in the courts being passed on to customers were legal appeals at the lower sums being awarded to plaintiffs. The practice known as \u201cprice-walking\u201d or a \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d is banned from today, and the Central Bank is tasked with reporting on its implementation in the sector. Central Bank research found that customers who stayed with their insurance provider for nine years or more were paying on average 14 per cent more for car insurance and 32 per cent more for home insurance. Under the Central Bank regulations companies will still be able to offer discounts to new customers but they can no longer add arbitrary costs to existing customers that don\u2019t contact them to query increased premiums. Mr Fleming said: \u201cIt was sharp practice. Most people feel you should get a loyalty bonus for being loyal to a particular company. They actually took advantage of the people and gave them the opposite of a bonus ... because they knew they weren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Mr Fleming said reductions to premiums of people impacted by the practice \u201cshould start happening promptly\u201d from July. Under the rules insurance companies will not be required to tell customers the reason for the price reduction and there is no comeback for people who feel they have been subject to price-walking. On this Mr Fleming says: \u201cThis process is forward looking. It\u2019s not retrospective. Straight up on that.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in has raised concern that the ban will only kick in for new customers on the second renewal, with Mr Doherty saying companies could \u201cdodge the ban\u201d by front-loading an increase on the first renewal quote. Mr Fleming says customers who feel they are being overcharged in the first renewal should \u201cmake a phone call or go online\u201d to challenge the quote and perhaps confront the company with a cheaper quote from another company for it to match. \u201cThat\u2019s actually what has to happen,\u201d Mr Fleming said. The Minister of State said the next priorities under the Government\u2019s insurance reform action plan would be to provide for mediation facilities at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) with the goal of preventing more cases going to court as well as duty-of-care legislation. Mr Fleming characterised the latter as relating to \u201cslips and trips\u201d. He said: \u201cIf you\u2019re walking along the street, or in a shop on your mobile phone and you walk into a pillar \u2015 it ain\u2019t the pillar\u2019s fault.\u201d Mr Fleming also said there was a duty on every property owner not to be careless or reckless. He said the injured party traditionally had the sympathy of the courts, especially if an insurance company was involved, and it was the \u201csingle biggest issue\u201d of concern to businesses. Mr Fleming said he believed the legislation \u201cwill change the whole tone of the industry, together with the reduced awards\u201d. He said it should result in fewer claims and those that did go through would get a \u201cmore realistic settlement\u201d. *This article was amended on July 1st, 2022",

            "date": "2022-11-03",
            "raw_text": "US insurance brokerage Arthur J Gallagher has bought Wexford-based broker Doyle Mahon Insurances, its first deal since entering the Irish market with the acquisition of brokerage group Innovu in the summer. While terms of the deal were not disclosed, the acquisition of the Ardcavan-based commercial and agricultural insurance broker will add about \u20ac10 million worth of gross written premium, along with some 4,000 clients and 20 staff, Gallagher Ireland chief executive Ronan Foley told The Irish Times on Thursday. The group of brokerages, which will formally rebrand as Gallagher from Innovu next week, will now have gross written premiums of \u20ac70 million, Mr Foley said, and 140 staff. In a statement, Doyle Mahon Insurances founder Colm Mahon said he and his business partner Pat Doyle were \u201cthrilled to become part of Gallagher\u2019s ambitious growth plans\u201d. \u201cIt is business as usual for our customers and they will continue to be supported by our excellent team in Wexford, however, by becoming part of a global business, we can further enhance our service and product offering,\u201d Mr Mahon said. The deal follows  several years of unprecedented consolidation  within the Irish market, which continues to attract private equity investment. Innovu, backed by MML, had been among the main driving forces behind this trend, snapping up five independent Irish brokers \u2013 most recently Cullen Insurances and Wexford-based PE Kelly Insurances in October last year. Before itself being acquired by Gallagher in June, Innovu had also inked deals for Sheridan Insurances, Wexford Insurances, and Goggin Insurance Brokers. Last month, Matt Pawley, president of New York-based insurance broker NFP\u2019s European operation, said he believed that  the \u201cvery hot\u201d Irish market would begin to slow down  amid rising interest rates and a changing macroeconomic environment. \u201cVolumes and prices will come down a bit. It just has to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple economics.\u201d However, Mr Foley said on Thursday that he does not agree with that assessment. \u201cWhat I\u2019m experiencing and in terms of our ambitious growth plans over the coming 18 months, I would see plenty of pace left in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly with Gallagher now in the market. It\u2019s their first time \u2013 as one of the world\u2019s biggest insurance brokers \u2013 being in the Irish market, so we have an added appetite to acquire the right-sized business, the right \u2018culture fit\u2019 business. So I can see there still being quite a bit of activity left in terms of consolidation.\u201d",

The organisation\u2019s pre-budget submission said that the \u201cunsustainable rise\u201d in insurance costs is having a very serious impact on charities, social enterprises and community and voluntary organisations. The group is seeking new legislation to rebalance the duty of care, as well as reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Wheel also wanted to see \u201ccontinued clear commitments\u201d from insurers in relation to cost reductions. The pre-budget submission also called for increased funding for community and voluntary organisations who provide the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Tusla with services. \u201cGovernment should make provision for sustainable terms and conditions to support staff retention and progression in HSE-funded Section 39 and Tusla-funded Section 56 organisations,\u201d the submission states. \u201cIncreases for services budgets have not been generally applied since the 2008 crisis and services are now significantly underfunded.\u201d The Wheel also called for the introduction of multi-annual funding arrangements, which would allow charities to plan long-term. The VAT compensation scheme for charities should also be retained and increased to \u20ac20 million annually in the upcoming budget, according to The Wheel. The scheme was first introduced in 2018 and it allows charities to claim a refund on a proportion of their VAT costs, based on their level of non-public funding. The scheme is capped at \u20ac5 million annually and was due to be reviewed this year. The Wheel also said that charities, community organisations and social enterprises should be included in all of the Government\u2019s pandemic recovery supports. The submission also stated that the introduction of a Charities Compliance and Reporting Matching Fund of \u20ac4.6 million, equivalent to the budget allocated to the Charities Regulator, would combat the cost of increased regulation of the sector. A direct tax incentive capped at \u20ac1 million should also be introduced for major gift donations, according to the submission, and the cost of making a will should be exempt from VAT if a charitable bequest is included in that will. The group also asked for a \u20ac10m investment in the Stability Fund for 2021, as well as a special \u20ac10m Charity Recovery Fund for 2022. The group also want to see dedicated funding to deliver the recommendations of three national strategies relating to the community and voluntary sector, social enterprises and volunteering.",

            "date": "2021-10-08",
            "raw_text": "Nuala, an actuary with almost 20 years of experience in the insurance industry, previously worked within Irish and international companies as well as heading up the Insurance Supervision division in the Central Bank of Ireland. As a result, Nuala is well placed to understand insurance regulatory requirements and the practical implications of those requirements for firms. Insurance executives heading back to the office this autumn after a long period of Covid-19 restrictions are facing a more complex work environment. We have witnessed how the global pandemic amplified the regulatory requirements and interventions triggered by the 2008 financial crisis and introduced some new risks including the controversy around business interruption insurance and the challenges of hybrid working. On top of that, the government\u2019s Action Plan for Insurance Reform, designed to make the industry more competitive and consumer friendly, will keep the pressure on. During my time at the Central Bank, culture within regulated financial services providers was a major focus. I expect this to continue. The Central Bank\u2019s leadership views the behaviour of financial services professionals, from the C-suite down, to be as important as capital requirements and operating rules. Reflecting that, the Central Bank is developing a Behaviour and Culture Framework, building on the work of previous reviews. Regulatory inspections are sure to follow and some of the biggest firms in the sector are already seeking pre-emptive culture assessments to prepare for such scrutiny. A major part of the Central Bank\u2019s focus on culture will be the Individual Accountability Framework, which will require financial firms to identify where the buck stops when things go wrong. Under this new regime, the individual responsibilities of top managers will have to be clearly mapped out under the Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR). The cover of \u2018decision by committee\u2019 will no longer apply and firms will have to make clear who is calling the shots within committee structures. A welter of new documentation will be required and companies must be ready to respond to information requirements. This will not just be about box-ticking: managers will have to show that these changes are embedded in how their company operates. Unsurprisingly, firms that are seeking to be best in class are already starting to benchmark their existing compliance with the Central Bank\u2019s fitness and probity rules, conduct and HR frameworks. For the Irish implementation, we have the benefit of lessons learned from the rollout of similar regimes in the UK, Singapore and elsewhere. As Grant Thornton is a global firm, we have taken insights from our international colleagues as we work with clients here on their journey to embed SEAR into their everyday operations. Business interruption cover and a spike in insurance premiums have put the spotlight on general insurers, but I expect the life insurance market to come increasingly into focus Operational resilience \u2013 the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption \u2013 has clearly jumped up the Central Bank\u2019s priority list during the Covid-19 crisis. The rollout of hybrid working models, complete work-from-home and full return-to-office in the wake of that crisis will bring different challenges and risks. Insurance companies which do not prepare for the forthcoming Central Bank Guidance on Operational Resilience risk falling foul of the regulator. Domhnall Cullinan, director of insurance in the Central Bank, has flagged that once the guidelines are introduced, firms must ensure they are compliant. Outsourcing, including intragroup outsourcing, is another focus for the Central Bank as it reviews companies\u2019 operational resilience. The regulator\u2019s concerns centre around the dependency created by outsourcing. Companies are increasingly reliant on a third party, or sometimes a chain of third parties, to deliver their services, meaning they are exposed if things go wrong. The Guidance on Operational Resilience should be considered in conjunction with the Cross-Industry Guidance on Outsourcing, which outlines the Central Bank\u2019s expectations on governance and management of outsourcing risk. This guidance also contains reminders for boards and senior management about their responsibility in overseeing and monitoring their outsourcing arrangements. Business interruption cover and a spike in insurance premiums have put the spotlight on general insurers, but I expect the life insurance market to come increasingly into focus. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority is currently developing a framework on unit-linked products which will inevitably draw attention to the prices savers are charged and the returns they receive. Value for money is the key area of concern and we expect to see a focus within the framework on fees and, in particular, fee transparency. The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) is a vital tool for companies but the Central Bank has recently signaled that some firms still see it as a compliance exercise. All companies should pause before their next ORSA submission to ensure that they can provide evidence of board engagement and challenge, and also demonstrate that the ORSA is at the core of everything they do. For example, companies should have updated the ORSA to show the potential impacts of Covid-19 on their businesses. Finally, all insurers need to draw up and maintain pre-emptive recovery plans. Companies need to spend time and energy on these documents to ensure they are realistic and can stand up to regulatory scrutiny. Executives tell us that, like so many other regulatory requirements facing them, recovery planning is a drain on resources. That may be so, but the central bank will want to see evidence that the plan is thoughtful, comprehensive and fully embedded into the organisation. The array of regulations, new and old, facing insurers is immense. Firms need to take a pro-active approach. Those who identify the opportunities as well as the challenges arising from the European and Irish regulatory regimes and factor them into their business plans will come out on top.",

            "raw_text": "The dramatic fall in personal injuries awards during the two months of operation of new guidelines will have an impact on insurance premiums, T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar has said. According to preliminary findings of a new report, the drop in awards came about following the introduction of new guidelines which set out levels of damages that may be awarded or assessed in respect of personal injuries. They reduce the award levels for most categories of injury. The update on the Government's Action Plan for Insurance Reform, which was due to be brought to Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, cites data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). It suggests that there has been a significant fall in the value of awards since the long-awaited new personal injuries guidelines came into operation on April 24th. The report is understood to show that the guidelines have had an impact, with the latest figures showing that 78 per cent of awards were \u20ac15,000 or less now, compared to some 30 per cent last year. However, neither Mr Varadkar nor Minister of State for Insurance Sean Fleming said they were in a position to say by how much premiums would fall. \u201cIt should mean a meaningful and recognisable fall in premiums,\u201d Mr Varadkar said, adding he could not say at this stage if they would fall by a particular figure. \u201cWe want them to explain why premiums aren\u2019t falling if they don\u2019t fall and that can\u2019t be on the basis of profit,\u201d he added. \u201c[Insurance companies] should not allow this to work its way through the court system. They should be in a position to reduce insurance premiums right away,\u201d he said. Mr Fleming said: \u201cSome of [the insurance companies] have reported a fall but some have said they will need a few months [before determining the extent].\u201d The level of awards that have been agreed since April 24th, when the new guidelines drawn up by the Judicial Council came into effect. Mr Varadkar and Mr Fleming held a media briefing at Dublin Castle following the Cabinet meeting where they presented an update of the action plan on insurance reform. 34 of the 66 aims have been implemented to date, the Ministers said. Data supplied by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) for the memorandum pointed to a substantial reduction in the quantum for awards. It found that 78 per cent of awards were \u20ac15,000 or less now, compared to 30 per cent last year. Among the major goals in the action plan completed are reforms of perjury legislation and the setting up of new office to ensure competition in the insurance market. The Personal Injuries Guidelines were published by the Judicial Council which is a body composed of all judges in Ireland. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee commenced the new system on April 24th. Under the new guidelines, the levels are substantially lower than previous levels for a significant number of injuries, while they are higher in a small number of categories. The new guidelines are also more granular and cover a broader range of personal injury types. The Alliance for Insurance Reform on Tuesday called on insurance companies to cut premiums following the drop of 50 per cent in awards in personal injury cases. The organisation's director Peter Boland said insurance costs in Ireland had been an \"existential issue\" for the past five years and despite the drop in awards in the last two months, there had been no reduction in premiums. Speaking on RT\u00c9 radio's Morning Ireland, Mr Boland warned that Irish society will not recover at pace unless \"this is sorted out\". There were 35 sectors who still could not get insurance cover and he was calling on the Government to \u201cget a move on this issue.\u201d The sectors involved could not wait for the remainder of the requirements on the action plan to come through. The impact of the new guidelines should have happened back in March, he said. Ireland was completely out of line with the rest of Europe when it came to insurance, he added. It was \u201cfarcical\u201d to still be talking about insurance as \u201can existential issue\u201d while it was just another utility bill elsewhere.",

            "raw_text": "A \u201cmisperception that loyalty is rewarded\u201d in the insurance industry is one of the reasons behind people being slow to switch providers, a study by the Central Bank has found. The research, which focused on engagement and switching patterns among car and home insurance consumers, found that a quarter of consumers in the State mistakenly believed that loyalty to an existing provider would be financially rewarded. These consumers are significantly less likely to switch, it said. The finding highlighted \u201cthe universal importance of providing clear and accurate information to the public domain to enable consumers to make the right choices for themselves\u201d, it said. [\u00a0 Irish Life Health announces 4.5% hike to the price of its insurance plans \u00a0] The study, which drew on a survey of 5,500 insurance policyholders in the Republic, found that 80 per cent of car and home insurance consumers will engage with their provider when their policy comes up for renewal, while about one in four will switch provider. Consumers are more likely to engage with and/or switch provider if, on renewing their policy, the price increases, it said. Behavioural characteristics were found to play a significant role, with certain consumers more likely to stick with the status quo, \u201ceven when doing so may not be financially beneficial\u201d. \u201cTime-poor consumers\u201d were also less likely to switch. What will the easing of bankers\u2019 pay restrictions do for competition dynamics? The research also examined the use of digital information and channels in purchasing insurance, noting that about 55 per cent of consumers here used the internet when buying products. However, one in five policyholders reported difficulties in using the internet to search for and purchase financial purchases, including insurance. \u201cThese consumers tend to be older, lower income, and less educated,\u201d it said, noting that policyholders who are less comfortable with digital channels were also more likely to exhibit status quo bias. The research \u201chighlights the role of consumer psychology in creating obstacles to engagement and switching\u201d, the Central Bank said. \u201cIn order to design effective disclosures and consumer protection policies, it is important to take consumer psychology and insights from behavioural economics into account,\u201d it added. \u201cThe Central Bank expects firms to take account of such factors as part of their efforts to support consumers in making fully informed decisions,\u201d it said. Responding to the latest research, Brokers Ireland said while it is positive that eight out of ten engage with their provider on car and home insurance at renewal, it is worrying that one in four believes that loyalty to an existing provider will be rewarded. Diarmuid Kelly, chief executive of Brokers Ireland said: \u201cWe know from previous research by the Central Bank that renewing customers were paying significantly more than the expected cost of the policy, while new business customers were paying marginally less. \u201cHowever, it was disappointing that the CBI when making changes this year preventing insurance companies charging consumers more each year they stayed with the same insurer, unlike the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, stopped short of recommending a complete ban on differential or dual pricing,\u201d he said. The regulator this year banned the practice whereby home and motor insurance companies impose so-called loyalty penalties on long-standing customers, also known as price walking.",

            "raw_text": "The vast majority of Irish consumers have never switched health insurance provider despite significant savings to be made by shopping around, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) has found. In its annual consumer survey published on Wednesday morning it found that 71 per cent of the more than 2 million people with private health insurance have never moved provider. The average length of time people have had a health insurance policy is 20 years while the average length of time people have stayed with their current provider is 15 years, the survey said. Almost 70 per cent have no plans to change their cover when their renewal is due. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Over 22 per cent of people with health insurance are over 65 years old and those over 55 are paying significantly more often as a result of being on the same policy for a long period of time. The chief executive of the HIA Ray Dolan described the consumer inertia as \u201cinteresting\u201d and said the HIA always recommends shopping around. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t necessarily have to change provider, switching between plans with the same providers is also an option,\u201d he said. According to the HIA, saving money remains the main driver for switching health insurance provider, followed by the level of cover. Health insurance customers would want to save at least 22 per cent to consider switching, down from 30 per cent in 2021 and 2019. All told only 15 per cent of those who took part in the survey said they would find it very difficult to change health insurance, which, the HIA said \u201cimplies that most people do not find it challenging despite the proliferation of plans\u201d. The reasons cited for not changing included being happy with their current provider or believing that the cost saving would not be enough to entice them to switch. However, 44 per cent of people acknowledged that it can be difficult to understand how health insurance works, and the terminology that is used. Cost is a significant factor in not buying health insurance with almost half of those interviewed citing costs as the main barrier. Among younger adults, one in five said they didn\u2019t have health insurance because they were satisfied with public services. As in previous years, private health insurance is considered a necessity rather than a luxury by almost 60 per cent of those surveyed. There remains a firm belief that health insurance enables people to access better healthcare services and to fast-track access to those services. The majority either take out health insurance because of perceived inadequate public services or to avoid waiting times. It found a third of people would never give up their health insurance unless they felt the health system improved or they really couldn\u2019t afford it. The majority of people interviewed felt that health insurance price hikes are not appropriate or justified. The survey based on over 2,000 face-to-face interviews also found that men are more likely to have cover than women and be either older or have child dependents.

            "raw_text": "Global insurance broker Lockton\u2019s Irish operation has struck its fourth deal since the start of the year by agreeing to buy Waterford corporate pension advisory company Fitzgerald Life & Pensions. Lockton Ireland, which has been active in the market since 1982 as a general insurance broker, hired senior New Ireland Assurance executives Ray McKenna and Niall O\u2019Callaghan last year to develop a strategy to get into the employee benefits space. The four acquisitions \u2013 which also include health insurance advisory firm  TotalHealthCover.ie ; corporate pensions adviser Independent Financial Advisory Trust; and Burke Pensions & Financial Services \u2013 have cost the group close to \u20ac10 million in total, according to Mr McKenna. Mr McKenna said the company has another deal in the pipeline. However, he added that it is becoming more cautious as price expectations among would-be sellers have been increasing of late as a result of some of the \u201ccrazy\u201d valuation multiples \u2013 relative to earnings \u2013 that the general insurance broker market has seen in recent times as consolidation in that sector continues at pace. The latest purchase will increase the company\u2019s number of corporate clients to 350 and raises its Irish employee base to more than 40. Lockton Ireland expects to continue to increase its Irish headcount in the coming months, bringing the total workforce to around 60. The firm also expects that its 2022 acquisitions will push its Irish business\u2019s annualised revenues to about \u20ac7 million by April 2023. Some 40 per cent of that will come from organic growth, according to Mr McKenna. The Irish entity, registered as Lockton Insurance Brokers Ireland Ltd, reported turnover of \u20ac2.29 million for the year to April 2021, down from \u20ac3.49 million for the prior year, according to its latest set of financial accounts. The Irish pensions market is navigating new EU pension legislation (IORP II), which brings a new layer of corporate governance and regulatory requirements to the pensions market from the start of 2023. As part of this employers need to decide whether to work with the far more onerous regulations under IOPR II or move their employee pension scheme to a so-called master trust.",

            "raw_text": "People who travel outside of Ireland have been warned they will invalidate their travel insurance even if the country they visit is on the so-called green list of safe countries due to be published by the Government. Travel insurance exclusions denying cover to people who travel contrary to official guidance are the norm across the sector and as it stands the advice from the Government is that non-essential journeys overseas should be avoided. The publication of the green list will not change that advice and an insurance industry group said this meant that anyone who decides to travel overseas will be doing so without cover. This could create complications should a policy holder fall ill or be the victim of a crime while abroad. While those in possession of a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) will be able to access medical care in most public hospitals in Europe, they will have to bear the costs of private treatments or repatriation, which can run to tens of thousands, if it is necessary. They will also have no cover for lost bags, criminal damage or cancelled flights while they are overseas. Insurance Ireland has advised all would be travellers planning on booking a holiday to a green list country \u201cto check with their insurer as to whether they are covered first\u201d. A spokeswoman for the group pointed out that a green list \u201cdoes not equate to a relaxation\u201d of the guideline stating non-essential travel is to be avoided. \u201cGovernment advice still remains that only essential travel should be undertaken and we await further clarity on any change to this position,\u201d she said. The Government plans to ease travel restrictions to and from some countries with the publication of the green list of countries with similar coronavirus infection rates to Ireland. Travellers returning from those countries will not have to self-isolate for 14 days. Minister for Agriculture Dara Calleary said the green list was being created because the State would be living with Covid-19 for some time and that there had to be a structure for business travel and for people coming into Ireland. Ryanair at the weekend said it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d putting its business interests ahead of public health concerns and that \u201ctravel is not the bogeyman\u201d when it comes to the spread of Covid-19. The airline\u2019s chief executive Eddie Wilson criticised the Government for what he said was its \u201chalf baked quarantine\u201d rule and he called for travel restrictions to be lifted for countries across the EU, with the exception of Sweden. He denied that he was making the call to protect Ryanair and expressed concern for Irish tourism operators who, he told RT\u00c9\u2019s The Business, were facing bankruptcy unless visitors from overseas were allowed to travel to the country unimpeded by any Covid-19 related restrictions.",

            "raw_text": "Running a big budget surplus is \u201cthe best insurance policy you can have\u201d, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  Paschal Donohoe  has said, defending the Coalition\u2019s core message of economic prudence as he prepares to hammer out next month\u2019s  budget  with his Government colleagues. In an interview for The Irish Times Inside Politics podcast, Mr Donohoe strongly made the case for his brand of political centrism \u2013 \u201cto make the case for centrism, or moderation, of itself can feel a little bit radical,\u201d he says \u2013 but he also acknowledged the failures of the centre in Ireland. On the story of the day, Mr Donohoe is guarded: \u201cWe need a viable  RT\u00c9 . We need a public service broadcaster. It\u2019s essential to our society and its understanding of how institutions function,\u201d he says. But he is non-committal on RTE\u2019s performance in fulfilling that role, and won\u2019t budge on questions about funding the station. He says he will scrutinise the submissions by RT\u00c9 \u2013 seeking an interim bailout of more than \u20ac50 million, according to reports \u2013 \u201creally, really carefully\u201d. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Then, he says, he will bring proposals to Government for any RT\u00c9 bailout. Mr Donohoe has a reputation as something of a hardliner within Government on the RT\u00c9 issue \u2013 he is likely to want to see deep reform and cost-cutting before he commits any more public money to the station. He strongly rejects the assertion that the Government has contributed to RTE\u2019s difficulties by failing to reform the licence fee over the years. Is he prepared to contemplate anything like the \u20ac50 million that RT\u00c9 is looking for? That\u2019s a budget question, he says, and won\u2019t go there. But he offers little by way of encouragement to the broadcaster except in the most general sense, insisting that he favours some public funding for public service broadcasting. Is this budget more difficult than the others he has? \u201cThe most difficult budgets that I was involved in were the Covid budgets \u2013 the budgets that happened in 2020 and in 2021, particularly the first of those two ... The levels of uncertainty about the basics of our society and out economy at that point were so high that framing a budget in that environment was by some measure the most difficult I was ever involved in.\u201d But this one is different? Paschal Donohoe on spending v saving, RT\u00c9's future and Fine Gael's vigour \u201cAbsolutely yes. I accept that it is a difficult argument to make, about why should we not spend all of the money available to us today, why should we not do it. \u201cThere\u2019s a school of thought that says if you\u2019re explaining you\u2019re losing in politics. I disagree with that completely. I think that\u2019s an enormously reductive view of what politics is about. Politics, particularly for those of us who aspire to be in Government which I do, is about making decisions and then explaining the decisions. \u201cI believe that even with all the pressures we\u2019re going to touch on, there\u2019s such a really strong argument about why maintaining a budget surplus has served us well in the past, but could serve us even more in the future.\u201d But really nobody is making the argument that we should spend all the surplus, are they? He contests this, strongly. \u201cIs anyone saying we should spend all of the 10 billion? One or two are. But actually in the round, putting all of the different requests together, would easily spend the entire surplus. And that\u2019s the point.\u201d Those requests are coming from his colleagues, in many cases. But we know the entire surplus won\u2019t be spent. The question is where he draws the line \u2013 it\u2019s likely that the budget day package will be \u20ac10-11 billion. Very big, maybe, but not big enough to keep everyone happy. Mr Donohoe doesn\u2019t bite. \u201cThe majority of the opposition I face in the D\u00e1il every day are up for spending it. They\u2019re up for spending it. And they question even the philosophy of why we have a surplus.\u201d Mr Donohoe is, he says, guided the failures of the past, the long shadow of the financial crisis and the subsequent era of austerity which left such deep social scars, and \u2013 though he doesn\u2019t mention it \u2013 upended the pre-existing political order, sweeping away nearly a century of the Fine Gael-Fianna F\u00e1il duopoly. \u201cIt\u2019s my defining experience of politics, starting off as a councillor in 2004 and when I got into the Oireachtas from [2007] onwards \u2013 the trauma, on an individual level, beyond the big events of Nama and going into an IMF programme, and what that meant for the lives of the people I represent. \u201cThat\u2019s why a continual theme in the arguments that I\u2019ve made \u2013 and there are ups and downs along the way, God knows you don\u2019t get everything right \u2013 is that not spending every cent that you have is not a guarantee that there\u2019ll never be a bust, but it\u2019s the best insurance policy that you have,\u201d he says. The fact, he says, that the public finances are in such robust health is not just an crash. It\u2019s not \u201ca background event that just happened.\u201d It is, he animatedly insists, the result of political choices. The reason the corporation tax receipts are in Ireland is because the companies are in Ireland, he says, \u201cwhich in turn is the result of political and policy choices \u2013 not all of which I\u2019ve made, it goes without saying. Predecessors over decades have made those choices as well. But there is a thesis and an argument regarding that model which I believe has played a vital role in the transformation of our state.\u201d He cites concerns about the most recent figures for corporation tax showing a fall-off from the levels seen last year. But even on this he advocates caution \u2013 wait until November, he says, and then we\u2019ll have a better idea. That, of course, is after the budget. In the absence of financial stability, all the other things you want to do, you can\u2019t do Isn\u2019t that an argument for running an even bigger surplus? And having fewer giveaways in the budget? \u201cThis goes back to my role and the role of Michael [ McGrath, the Minister for Finance ] as politicians as well, where we recognise all of the different competing demands that we have to respond back to.\u201d Going beyond a \u20ac10 billion surplus right now, he says, \u201cwould not be feasible\u201d. Is fiscal prudence the Government\u2019s big idea? \u201cWe have a group of parties in the political centre that do differ but are united in the view that the political centre serves our country well and can respond back to all the ills, all the difficulties we have. \u201cAnd in the time of raised voices and competing and simple arguments, I know to make the case for centrism, or moderation, of itself can feel a little bit radical. But I believe the centre has served this country well, and this is a Government of the centre.\u201d But hasn\u2019t his sensible centrism failed many of the people who now feel that they have no chance of owning a home, who feel excluded from having that stake in society? \u201cAnd this is why I am \u2013 despite the vigour of our debate here, which is great \u2013 I make the case for a degree of humility about the political centre. I make the case for it ... but the centre itself has to acknowledge its own failings, its own deficiencies.\u201d He knows that the centre has failed to realise the expectations of many people. But he also adds that for too many people, the political centre has become identified with a conservative outlook, and the maintenance of the status quo. But, he adds, citing the efforts on his home patch of Dublin Central, where the State has been trying various approaches to help disadvantaged areas, sometimes successful, sometimes not: \u201cYou keep on trying, you keep on trying different things.\u201d Typically, he brings the argument back to the need for careful and prudent management of the public finances: \u201cIn the absence of financial stability, all the other things you want to do, you can\u2019t do.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Financial services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers paid \u20ac53 million to settle a \u20ac900 million legal claim for negligent auditing over the collapse of Quinn Insurance, The Irish Times has learned. The settlement was one of the biggest of its kind in Irish corporate history. But the State fund that pays the liabilities of the failed insurer received considerably less than \u20ac53 million because of large legal fees incurred in the case against PwC. The disclosure of the settlement terms comes one day before the Central Bank meets the D\u00e1il Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday to discuss the affairs of the Insurance Compensation Fund, which is financed by a 2 per cent surcharge on all home and motor insurance policies in the State. The insolvent insurer has been run for 13 years by administrators Michael McAteer and Paul McCann of accountants Grant Thornton. They took charge in 2010 as Co Cavan entrepreneur Se\u00e1n Quinn, once considered to be the wealthiest Irish businessman, lost control of an empire that included cement, manufacturing, hospitality and banking interests. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Between 2011 and 2015, the exchequer paid out \u20ac1 billion to meet Quinn Insurance liabilities. Quinn\u2019s administrators sued PwC for negligent auditing of the insurance underwriter in 2005-2008. The firm denied such claims but settled last June on terms not disclosed then. When PwC legal fees of some \u20ac25 million were paid, the cost to the firm was \u20ac78 million. That sum is considered virtually certain to have been covered by PwC\u2019s professional indemnity insurers. The administrators ran up similar legal fees, which were deducted from the amount paid to the Insurance Compensation Fund. Some figures briefed on the settlement said the ultimate benefit to the fund was between \u20ac20 million and \u20ac30 million. The \u20ac53 million settlement was confirmed by two people familiar with the arrangement but PwC, Grant Thornton and the Central Bank each declined to comment. Similarly, the Department of Finance was silent on the terms: \u201cThe department welcomes the settlement reached which resulted in the finalisation of this long-running case, was a positive gain for the ICF, and avoided escalation of further costs.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Arachas, the largest insurance broker in the State, is set to buy Dublin-based marine insurance broker D&D Insurances for an undisclosed sum, as it continues to be a leading player in an ongoing consolidation of the sector. D&D Insurances, led by chief executive Barry Donnellan, has been serving the Irish marine sector since 1986 and has long-established relationships with the key fishing ports and marine vessels around the State. It has four employees and had turnover of almost \u20ac640,000 last year, according to its latest set of accounts. Following the deal and the expected closure next year of a previously-announced deal to buy family-owned Glennon Insurances in Dublin for an estimated figure of more than \u20ac90 million, Arachas will have more than 650 employees. \u201cOur strategy has always been to look to acquire well-managed companies, specialising in specific market sectors,\u201d said Conor Brennan, chief executive of Arachas and of its parent group Ardonagh\u2019s European operations. The deal \u201cwill deepen our existing credentials in the marine sector and expand insurance options for our customer base and also for D&D Insurances\u2019 existing customers,\u201d he said. Arachas saw its net profit soar by 63 per cent last year to \u20ac22.9 million, fuelled by acquisitions as it continued to play a leading role in ongoing consolidating the market. The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. Ardonagh, which acquired Arachas in 2020 for \u20ac250 million, is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Partners. Last year saw Arachas buy Mayo-based MCM Insurance Brokers, which is focused on the construction, hospitality and professional indemnity sectors, BJP Insurance in Dublin and Kilkenny-based fintech Orange Bear Consultancy for undisclosed sums. It also took over the assets of Waterford-based Hooper Dolan at the start of this year in a deal believed to be worth more than \u20ac60 million.",

The Irish unit, McGill and Partners Ireland, received authorisation from the Central Bank of Ireland before Christmas, allowing the group to continue to offer services to clients in Europe post-Brexit. Stephen Cross, chief executive of the Irish unit and a founding partner of the group, said he expects to grow the Dublin operation from an initial five people to between 20 and 30 within 12 months. \u201cWhile the insurance broking business is often about buying companies and rolling up, we\u2019re looking to grow rapidly through the acquisition of talent,\u201d said the Irishman, who held a number of senior roles with Aon during more than a decade and a half with the group, until 2017. Growth McGill and Partners was set up in 2019 with backing from global private-equity group Warburg Pincus and has dealt with more than \u20ac1 billion of premiums in its first 15 months of business. Its staff count has grown to 275 people, including 100 hires during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Mr Cross. The company focuses on complex insurance policies for clients spanning areas from property and casualty to marine, cargo, cyber and technology risk. Mr Cross said the group expects to deal with $4-$5 billion of premiums within five years. UK financial services firms have had to set up locally-regulated subsidiaries in the European Union following the end of Brexit transition arrangements in December, as the EU-UK trade deal did not cover services. Talks have only begun this month on how regulators on both sides will co-operate on financial services. The world's largest corporate insurance brokers are going through a wave of consolidation, providing scope for niche operators like McGill and Partners to pick up business. The planned $30 billion merger between Willis Towers Watson and Aon is being investigated by European competition authorities.

It will bring them back to a time when the host at sophisticated drinks parties (all drinks parties were sophisticated back then, I suspect) offered their guests either Muscadet and Fleurie if they were Francophiles, or Soave and Valpolicella if they preferred Italian. As demand increased for these wines, quality fell, and all four became shadows of their former selves. There were always quality producers but too often they were ignored in the rush for cheaper wine. I love basic Valpolicella, the good stuff anyway, and see it as one of the perfect summer wines. I may be in a minority, however, as none of the big supermarkets seem to offer one. Basic Valpolicella is light and refreshing with bright red fruits and low alcohol. Some can be a little too light and lack flavour but spend a few euro more and you will be rewarded with some very nice wines. Classico means the wine comes from the original high-quality mountainous region that usually produces better wines than basic Valpolicella. A Superiore must have 1 per cent more alcohol than regular Valpolicella and be aged for a year, usually in oak barrels. Served cool, it goes perfectly with a wide range of summer dishes, including antipasti, mixed salads, cold meats and cheeses. And pizza. Or, as a previous generation knows, with nibbles at a drinks party. I will leave Valpolicella Ripasso and Amarone, both sort of souped-up versions of plain Valpolicella, for another time, although I feature one widely available Ripasso below.

Energy strain may hit State\u2019s Intel plant chances The Republic\u2019s mounting energy infrastructure and waste challenges could hit its chances of securing a new multibillion-euro Intel microchip facility, according to the Business Post. Intel said earlier this month that the State was running for the plant, which could possibly lead to 10,000 jobs. The report said that Poland and Germany had been shortlisted alongside Ireland, but that Germany was believed to be in pole position to secure the facility due to energy supply concerns amid a surge in data centres and the increased electrification of the economy. State to import new electricity generators The Business Post also reports that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities will write to Eirgrid this week telling it to go ahead with plans to secure hundreds of millions of euro worth of emergency energy generations for winter 2022-23. It comes after efforts to secure the generators for this winter were abandoned last month for a number of reasons. Such emergency generators will be needed for a number of years as the State\u2019s power sector tries to catch up with soaring demand, the report states.

The newspaper said the traffic controllers claimed that an over-reliance on overtime to run the service had become a safety issue. It claimed that short gaps in the roster had resulted in Cork and Shannon airports being temporarily affected in July, while closure at Dublin Airport had been narrowly averted in August. The Irish Aviation Authority told the newspaper that it refuted the allegations in the letter \"in their entirety\".

The firm said is watching for any change in how the two blocs manage the insurance industry as so-called regulatory divergence \u201ccould result in the loss of some element of efficiency\u201d in its operating model, according to accounts for Royal London Insurance DAC for 2021 filed with the Companies Registration Office in Dublin. Royal London set up the subsidiary in Ireland in 2018 to keep serving the market here after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Possible regulatory divergence between the two regions since the Brexit vote has long been a concern for businesses, with numerous firms setting up entities in Ireland to retain access to EU markets. \u201cSeveral services are outsourced to our parent company to benefit from the economies of scale of the Royal London Group,\u201d the company directors said in the accounts. \u201cShould such divergence occur, requiring changes to the operating model, this could result in logistical challenges and increase run costs,\u201d they added. As a result, the Royal London has \u201cstrengthened its control framework\u201d that now involves \u201csystematic monitoring\u201d for any divergence in rules, they added. A Royal London spokesman declined to comment on the accounts. The Brexit trade deal implemented last year appeared to ease immediate concerns about the impact of possible changes in regulations. Still, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss \u2014 who is favourite to become the next Conservative Party leader and take over as Prime Minister next month \u2014 has pledged to to undo parts of the deal already in place. The EU has already started legal action against the UK over the proposed changes, and the dispute threatens to undermine the wider trade agreement. The potential Brexit issues came as the Irish business saw profits increase 40 per cent in 2021 compared to a year earlier to \u20ac8.3 million. That boosted accumulated profits to \u20ac131.5 million. Gross premiums written rose 11 per cent to \u20ac98.9 million. Overall staff costs totalled \u20ac1.2 million for the year.

            "date": "2021-09-22",
            "raw_text": "European commissioners Mairead McGuinness and Valdis Dombrovskis unveiled plans on Wednesday to ease capital rules for insurers to allow them to release \u20ac120 billion for investment over the long term. The released funds would help with the economic recovery from Covid-19 and promote investment in reaching climate goals, without reducing policyholder protection. The European Commission is also proposing a harmonised approach across the union for the rescue or winding-down of ailing insurers. It follows on from a wholesale overhaul of banking resolution in the wake of the financial crash. Investors The planned insurance reforms envisage debt investors facing losses \u2013 or being converted into equity holders \u2013 if an insurer runs into trouble. But they stop short of replicating other post-crash banking sector reforms, such as the setting-up of a single European resolution fund for companies in trouble, or an obligation that insurers issue specific amounts and types of debt that could be \u201cbailed in\u201d during a crisis. The Department of Finance and Central Bank of Ireland moved ahead of the publication of the EU plans by issuing a consultation paper earlier this month on a national resolution framework for insurers, asking whether the State should expand the role of the existing Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) or set up a standalone fund. The Irish consultation paper asks for comments from interested parties on whether arrangements be should put in place to ensure that any levies put on insurers \u201care not directly imposed on the policyholders\u201d. However, industry observers say that the costs will ultimately be borne by consumers. Lobby group Insurance Ireland said that the the EU proposal \u201cfalls short\u201d of an ambition to have a harmonised EU-wide approach to resolution. \u201cThe commission proposal focuses on national markets rather than the single market and might lead to inconsistencies and fragmentation,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, the commission\u2019s proposed amendment to capital rules, known as Solvency II and in force since 2016, would release \u20ac90 billon of capital in the short term and an additional \u20ac30 billion in the long term, according to a question-and-answer document accompanying the announcement. For context, EU insurers had more than \u20ac10 trillion of assets under management as of late 2020, according to industry body Insurance Europe. Amendments The aim is that the amendments, subject to approval from EU states and the European Parliament, will encourage insurers to invest to help the EU economy as it recovers from the pandemic as well as put money into green infrastructure and projects to help the EU reach its objective of being carbon neutral by 2050. \u201cToday\u2019s proposal will help the insurance sector step up and play its full part in the EU economy,\u201d said Ms McGuinness, the commissioner in charge of financial services, financial stability and capital markets. \u201cWe are enabling investment in the recovery and beyond. And we\u2019re fostering the participation of insurance companies in the EU\u2019s capital markets, providing the long-term investment that is so vital for a sustainable future. Our growing capital markets union is essential for our green and digital future. We\u2019re also paying close attention to the consumer perspective; policyholders can be reassured that they will be better protected in future if their insurer runs into difficulties.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "We tend to be quite fond of all the bits and bobs of stuff we\u2019ve collected over the years and the place in which we house them. The collection of commemorative Princess Diana plates and the customised built-in storage we had built for them. The custom utility room with a workhorse washing machine that takes on the entire muddy kit for under-12\u2032s football in one wash. A hallway with artwork, a bedroom with an orthopaedic mattress and a jewellery box with grandma\u2019s rings. A carefully organised garage with a curated collection of power tools that you\u2019ve grown emotionally attached to over the years. We baulk at the thought of losing anything we have worked hard for or care about due to upsetting and unforeseen circumstances. Things like fires, floods or robberies that can leave us not just with the heartache of our precious stuff gone but the financial headache of replacing it. Some treasures with sentimental value can never be replaced, like your children\u2019s first baby shoes or a Galway jersey Micheal Donnellan signed in 1998 that you\u2019ve refused to let anyone wash since because it has his sweat on it. Whatever your prized possession is, there is something to be said for making sure you can recoup some of your losses and start again if the worst were to happen to your home and contents. This is where home insurance comes into play. Like seemingly everything else these days, the price of premiums has gone up by double digits. \u201cConsumers are seeing increases of over 20 per cent,\u201d said Demot Wells, head of general and health insurance at Cornmarket. [\u00a0 What is going on with home insurance pricing in Ireland? \u00a0] [\u00a0 Home insurance costs rise as owners are urged to ensure properties are adequately covered \u00a0] Which means people are starting to seek out the best-value coverage. \u201cThe industry has seen a huge increase in consumers shopping around as a result of significant price increases,\u201d said Wells. So what are things to be on the lookout for when trying to nab the best deal on home insurance? Be wary of underinsurance \u2018The biggest risk for consumers at present is underinsurance,\u201d stressed Wells. Last year, the Central Bank rang an alarm about underinsurance in the market after finding it had more than doubled from 6.5 per cent in 2017 up to 16.5 per cent in 2022. This meant a rising number of consumers were being left vulnerable with policies and payouts not keeping pace with the increase of building costs and materials. For example a previous policy that might have covered a family to rebuild their home if it burned down might now not be enough and they could be left holding the bill. And that shortfall could be hefty, according to figures from the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland. The base rebuild cost for a 95sq m three bed semidetached house in Dublin, Cork and Waterford rose by \u20ac10,000, \u20ac10,000 and \u20ac12,000 respectively in 2019, 2020 and 2021, SCSI research found. To paint a picture of just how high and quick costs jumped, from 2021 to 2022, prices saw a \u20ac43,610  increase  for a similar 98sq m rebuild in Dublin, \u20ac48,584 in Cork and a whopping \u20ac56,524 in Waterford. The Central Bank put the word out to insurers last year to notify all policyholders about underinsurance risks, stating \u201cmore could be done by firms to highlight the practical consequences of underinsuring their home\u201d. In April  The Irish Times r eported one in six claims made to a leading provider weren\u2019t paid out in full due to policyholders renewing their premiums without taking into account the building price hikes according to research from Aviva. However, the same research found fewer than one in 10 of those people warned that they might not have sufficient coverage had taken any action, \u201cIt is estimated that potentially one-third of homeowners incorrectly insure their property as they base their insurance on the market value of the property and not the rebuilding costs,\u201d said Wells. \u201cAll buildings should be insured for their full replacement value, including the cost of demolition and debris removal.\u201d [\u00a0 Arachas profits soar 35% amid wave of insurance broker deals \u00a0] [\u00a0 Groceries, rent, insurance and electricity: Where are Irish consumers feeling the pinch? \u00a0] If a property is underinsured, Wells said \u201cthe value of any claim is reduced by whatever proportion is represented by the level of underinsurance\u201d. \u201cFor example, if your home was completely destroyed in a storm and was insured for \u20ac300,000 but the full rebuild cost is actually \u20ac400,000, then you would be underinsured by 100k or 25 per cent. \u201cIn the event of a claim, the most the insurer would pay is \u20ac300,000, meaning the policyholder will have to pay the other \u20ac100,000 \u2013 subject to terms, conditions and exceptions of the policy.\u201d This could be a \u201chuge financial strain on the owner at a very difficult time\u201d. Consumers can use the free, online  SCSI House Rebuild Calculator  to get a base idea of their potential current rebuild costs to see if they are covered by their policy \u2013 however there are limitations on the type of homes the listed per square metre rates apply to. Worried about being underinsured? These are the ways you can avoid it, says Wells. Aside from checking that \u201ccoverage aligns with your home\u2019s actual replacement cost, including any renovations or improvements\u201d, he advises policyholders update their coverage to \u201caccount for inflation and changes in your home\u2019s value\u201d. And keep an eye out for inflation protection also known as indexation or index linking in a policy. \u201cIt helps policyholders stay up to date with inflation by automatically increasing their sums insured each year in line with different building cost indexes, such as the DCE building cost index.\u201d Aside from underinsurance, consumers need to be careful their policy matches their unique needs \u2013 does it cover building insurance and content insurance? Is there a rare watch collection included or does that require a separate policy? What about if someone nicks your bike from the shed but the shed is technically a communal shed on a shared bit of land? Read the fine print to find out. Seek discounts Insurers and consumers reassessing policies after the Central Bank\u2019s underinsurance warnings and the skyrocketing building costs played a part in home insurance seeing a 22 per cent price increase this year. It sounds like a really boring version of the film Inception but did you know insurance companies purchase insurance on themselves? It\u2019s called \u201creinsurance\u201d and it\u2019s so the insurer can \u201cprotect itself from the risk of loss\u201d but it\u2019s us who could end up paying for it, explained Wells. [\u00a0 New health insurance increases to add hundreds to annual cost \u00a0] [\u00a0 \u2018We are in uncharted waters on health insurance pricing\u2019 \u00a0] \u201cReinsurance costs continue to rise and insurers tend to pass some or most of this cost on,\u201d he said. Rising building costs have a knock-on effect on the price of premiums as potential payout amounts have to keep pace. Other things that raise premium prices include previous claims on your policy and insurers updating their \u201cstatistical models used to assess and rate risk\u201d. The good news is that some factors, within the control of some consumers, can lower premiums. According to Wells, \u201cdiscounts are available for installing security systems, specific types of locks on doors and windows, smoke alarms and other safety features\u201d as well as considering bundling policies with the same insurer as they \u201coffer discounts for having more than one policy with them\u201d. Paying your insurance annually might also see you paying less by avoiding monthly direct debit charges. Also, try adding or increasing voluntary excess at your own risk. Going a full year without claiming means your insurer could \u201creward you with a discount on next year\u2019s premium\u201d. With the annual discount getting bigger with \u201ceach claims-free year after that\u201d. Best deals While no-claims discounts might make it seem like sticking with your current insurer is worth it, Wells says it\u2019s still \u201cgood practice to shop around and compare quotes from different insurers during the renewal period to ensure you\u2019re getting the best value\u201d. The decision to stay or leave will depend on the individual\u2019s circumstances such as \u201cloyalty discounts, competitiveness of your provider\u2019s rates, whether you have had a claim etc.\u201d If you\u2019re already insured, then Wells advises your first step should be to get on to your current insurer and broker and ask them for the best price. Then it\u2019s time to \u201cmake sure you get all the discounts you are entitled to\u201d, including loyalty and multiple policy ones. Once you have that or if you\u2019re a first-timer, next compare quotes from multiple insurers but don\u2019t leave it to the last minute \u201cTake the time in advance of renewal to shop around various insurers and brokers to satisfy yourself you are getting the best price.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "While nearly 50 per cent support making e-scooters legal for use in Ireland, 65 per cent of those surveyed by AA Ireland said insurance should be required when using the vehicles, 41 per cent said tax should be required and 54 per cent said users should require a licence. Currently, e-scooters are classed as \u2018mechanically propelled vehicles\u2019. This means that they cannot be used in a public place without tax, insurance and an appropriate category of driving licence. However, on Tuesday the Cabinet approved a new Road Traffic Bill to legislates for the   use of e-scooters and e-bikes  on Irish roads. The Bill is due to go before the D\u00e1il and should be concluded before the end of this year. A spokesperson for the Department of Transport stated that the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 will create a new vehicle category to be known as \u2018Powered Personal Transporters\u2019 (PPTs) which will include e-scooters and similar devices. The AA Ireland survey of 8,241 people found that 60 per cent of people do not think e-scooters are used safely in Ireland and 39 per cent do not support legalisation. Speed limits and safety gear If legalised, 64 per cent said strict speed limits should be put in place, while 84 per cent said safety restrictions should be required \u2013 such as obligatory helmets, lights and high-visibility clothing. Just 4 per cent of those surveyed said e-scooters should be allowed on footpaths, while 35 per cent said users of e-scooters should follow the same rules as bicycles. Under the new Bill, a speed limit of 25km/h will be implemented, as well as measures on how to deal with using these vehicles under the influence of alcohol, careless driving or using mobile phones while driving. An age limit will also be introduced, making it an offence to supply PPTs to persons under the age of 16 years. They will also not be allowed on motorways or bus lanes, but drivers will be permitted to use cycleways. Anna Cullen of AA Ireland said the organisation is broadly supportive of the proposed conditions of use and the introduction of legislation to allow for the use of e-scooters in Ireland. \"It is important, however, that at all times any supporting legislation legalising such devices protects the safety of all road users through restrictions on what kind of e-scooter can be used and where.\" \u201cAs the use of such devices increases in the coming years, assuming for their legalisation, a greater investment in infrastructure to meet the needs of those commuting by both conventional bicycle and e-scooter will certainly be needed,\u201d said Ms Cullen.",

Lockton Ireland, which has been active in the market since 1982 as a general insurance broker, hired senior New Ireland Assurance executives Ray McKenna and Niall O'Callaghan last year to develop a strategy to get into the employee benefits space. That new division has now entered a deal to buy insurance health advisory consultants Total Health Cover, which was established by Dermot Goode in 2010 and works with employers and individuals across the State to advise on health insurance plans and broader wellbeing supports. Financial details It has also agreed to take control of Independent Financial Advisory Trust (Ifat), a Dublin-based financial broker with a focus on advising corporate pension clients. Lockton Ireland declined to give financial details of the deal. However, the company said the acquisitions, together with further deals in the works, should see the Irish business\u2019s revenues rise to about \u20ac7 million for the financial year to April 2023. The Irish entity, registered as Lockton Insurance Brokers Ireland Ltd, reported a turnover of \u20ac2.29 million for the year to last April, down from \u20ac3.49 million for the prior year, according to its latest set of financial accounts. Gary Ennis is the head of Lockton's Irish general insurance brokers operation. Employee benefits Lockton's move into the space of advising companies on employee benefits schemes comes at a time when Mercer, Willis Towers Watson and Aon dominate the corporate end of the market and Irish Life has been active in recent years acquiring mid-market brokers to drive more business its way. Mr McKenna said that an estimated 50 per cent of the two million-plus people in the Republic with health insurance plans overpay annually on their premiums. \u201cMany of these plans are financially supported by employers, so cost is a major issue in many companies,\u201d he said. On the pensions front, Mr McKenna said Irish employers \u201cneed truly impartial advice to navigate the imminent impact of EU pension legislation (IORP II)\u201d, which brings a new layer of corporate governance and regulatory requirements to the pensions market.",

            "raw_text": "Loyalty could be costing the typical home insurance customer \u20ac161 a year, with the widespread use of dual pricing in the Irish market meaning that insurance companies are incentivising new customers rather than rewarding existing ones. This is one of the findings in a new review from the Central Bank into pricing in the car and home insurance markets, which also found that older people, by virtue of staying with their insurance provider for longer, were paying more for their car and home insurance due to the so-called \"loyalty premium\". The review, published on Monday, is the latest stage in a Government-backed process aimed at ensuring better outcomes for buyers of insurance by understanding how insurers price policies. It examined more than 11 million policies from the period 2017-2019, and found evidence of dual pricing across the private car and home insurance markets. The review was first signalled last year, when Derville Rowland, director general financial conduct at the Central Bank,suggested the regulator could consider an outright ban, but that it would be dependent on the outcome of this report. Dual pricing, or differential pricing, is when some consumers are charged higher prices than others. It is widespread not just in insurance but also across the travel and telecoms sectors, and typically happens when insurers charge new customers lower premiums than those who are renewing. Price sensitive The report found that customers who automatically renewed with their insurer were subsidising those who were more price sensitive and who shopped around to get lower new business rates. It also found evidence of \u201cprice walking\u201d, whereby insurers increase premiums incrementally each year for existing customers come renewal time. \u201cThe longer a customer remains with an insurer the higher cost they are paying,\u201d Ms Rowland said. The report gives the example of a customer being charged \u20ac312 for a home insurance policy, while a similar risked customer, who had been with the insurer for nine years, was charged \u20ac473. Where consumers do shop around, the report found that it was typically to try and negotiate a better price with their current provider, rather than switching. A much higher level of inertia was found in the home insurance market compared with private car insurance. Taking action The publication of the report comes after Sinn F\u00e9in announced it would publish a Bill this week to ban the practice in the Irish market, on the grounds that it was leading to consumers being charged artificially high premiums. In the UK the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has moved recently to ban the practice outright, while in the US, it is banned in some 20 states, including New York and Florida. Responding to the Sinn F\u00e9in move, Ms Rowland said that any action needed to be \u201cfinely calibrated\u201d to ensure that consumers would not lose out, and that the best way to achieve this was to let this \u201cdetailed piece of work to proceed\u201d. While the evidence found in the report suggested that immediate action could be warranted, Ms Rowland said that doing so would be \u201cprevious\u201d, and that it was important that a detailed understanding of the market be achieved. Ms Rowland noted that dual pricing had some benefits for consumers, because some will \u201cget a better price than they would normally expect to get\u201d and thus further analysis was needed to decide on the \u201cmost effective measures to protect consumers\u201d. According to its plan for the insurance sector, published last week, the regulator is expected to publish its final report in September 2021, with the Government taking appropriate action by the end of the following year.",

            "raw_text": "All of the outstanding issues between two of the four publicans that brought High Court actions over FBD\u2019s failure to pay out on business disruption claims caused by Covid-19 have been settled. On Friday the High Court was told that the other two test actions brought by bar owners Aberken, trading as Sinnott\u2019s Bar, and Hyper Trust Ltd, trading as The Leopardstown Inn, had been settled. Mr Justice Denis McDonald had held in a judgment last year, in a decision that had implications for more than 100 bars and restaurants, that a policy sold by FBD covered losses which pubs sustained by having to close due to the pandemic. Arising out of the court\u2019s findings, several issues, largely centred on the quantum of losses that are to be paid to the publicans by FBD, remained outstanding. Michael Cush SC appearing with James Doherty SC for Aberken and Hyper Trust told the court that those issues had been resolved following extensive and detailed out-of-court talks between the parties. The court is now considering submissions from Declan McGrath SC for FBD. Arising out of the settlement agreement, the insurer is seeking certain clarifications and declarations from the court regarding legal principles that arose in the case. FBD has asked the court for the reliefs because of the wider implications involved in the test cases given that the outcome of the test actions has implications for hundreds of other pubs and restaurants that had taken out business disruption cover with the insurer. In his submissions counsel said one of the issues the court had been asked to consider was the subsidies paid by the State to businesses like pubs that were forced to close as a result of the pandemic. Mr Justice McDonald, who congratulated the parties for resolving what were complex legal matters, welcomed the settlement. The hearing of FBD\u2019s bid for the various reliefs continues next week. The other two pub owners which had also taken test actions against FBD \u2013 Inn on Hibernian Way Ltd trading as Lemon & Duke, and Leinster Overview Concepts Ltd, the owner of Sean\u2019s Bar, in Athlone, Co Westmeath \u2013 had earlier resolved the majority of their outstanding claims against FBD. The only matter remaining between those two entities and FBD concerns the legal costs of the action. In his main judgment last year, Mr Justice McDonald disagreed with FBD\u2019s interpretation of its business disruption policy regarding Covid-19 and ruled in favour of the four publicans. The pub owners had challenged FBD\u2019s refusal to indemnify them, as well as the insurer\u2019s claim that its policies did not cover the disruption caused by Covid-19. The publicans claimed that under their policies of insurance they were entitled to have their consequential losses covered by the insurer. FBD claimed the policies contained a clause that states the pubs will be indemnified if their premises were closed by order of the local or government authority if there are \u201coutbreaks of contagious or infectious diseases on the premises or within 25 miles of same\u201d. The judge said that cover was not lost in such circumstances.",

The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) said the market remained in a strong position in 2022 with demand for health services continuing to rebound from Covid times. However, the impact of the pandemic remained visible on health services in 2022, though at a lower level than the previous two years. While hospital activity increased relative to the steep reduction observed in 2020 and 2021, it remained lower than pre-pandemic levels. Last year saw a return to pre-Covid levels of day treatments in hospitals, while overnight stays had not yet returned to pre-Covid levels. There were 2.44 million people with health insurance at the end of 2022, corresponding to 47.6 per cent of the total population, a 3 per cent increase on the previous year. The cost of climate change: \u2018almost like driving another budget through public finances\u2019 VHI Healthcare\u2019s market share was 48.4 per cent, Laya Healthcare had a 27 per cent market share and Irish Life Health had 20.5 per cent. However, market shares vary significantly by the ages of the insured. At the end of 2022, VHI Healthcare insured 54 per cent of those aged 70-79 with insurance, compared with 72 per cent at the end of 2014. The total level of claims paid in 2022 increased by 16.5 per cent on 2021. Total claims paid by insurers in 2022 have exceeded claims paid in 2019 before the pandemic (\u20ac2.25 billion) for the first time since Covid-19 impacted claims on health insurance. Feedback from consumer surveys commissioned by the HIA during 2022 showed that many consumers still find it difficult to understand their health insurance plans and compare options, particularly with more than 327 plans on the market. \u201cLast year we received over 3,000 calls to our consumer helpline, and almost 200,000 consumers used the HIA\u2019s comparison tool at  hia.ie ,\u201d said the HIA\u2019s chairwoman, Patricia Byron. \u201cWe encourage all consumers to assess their level of coverage each year and compare products available.\u201d Up to one million people with health insurance are facing substantial price hikes when renewing their policies between now and the end of February. Customers of  Laya Healthcare  who extend their health cover in the days ahead will see the cost climb by more than 10 per cent as two separate increases announced in recent months kick in. Irish Life customers who have renewed since earlier this summer have already had two increases applied to their policies. The State\u2019s largest private health insurer,  VHI , announced that its prices increased by an average of 7 per cent with effect from the beginning of this month. It is the second price increase the provider has imposed this year. In March, the company, which has more than 1.1 million subscribers, said it would increase prices by an average of 4.8 per cent, blaming increased demand for healthcare and rising costs.",

New personal injuries guidelines are set to be adopted and published by the Judicial Council by July 31st, but the group says that they \"have no idea what the new guidelines will look like or when we will get to see them, if at all, before they are adopted by the Courts\". In addition, the Alliance is also calling for reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), as if not \" radically reformed, it will be irrelevant within a decade\", The \u201ccommon duty of care\u201d should be redefined to require occupiers to take a duty of care that is \u201creasonable, practical and proportionate\u201d. \u201cWe await action from the Minister for Justice that will address the situation where many policyholders find themselves 100 per cent liable for accidents regardless of the circumstances,\u201d the group said. A formal Garda response to insurance fraud should also be established. \"Four years after the Cost of Insurance Working Group first addressed this issue and despite commitments from An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in 2019 to a division-led approach, we are no closer to having a formal Garda response to insurance fraud.\" Finally, the group wants to see forecasts on when reforms will lead to reductions in insurance costs, and is waiting on an assessment of the expected impact on premium levels of reforms being introduced from Minister of State Sean Fleming.",

            "raw_text": "The European Commission has accepted an offer from Insurance Ireland to provide non-members with clear and fair criteria to access an insurance claims database, drawing a line under a five-year cartel investigation. In its preliminary view in June last year, the commission said the industry group had arbitrarily delayed or, in practice, denied access by non-members to Insurance Link, a claims information exchange it administers. Insurance Ireland subsequently submitted concessions to the EU competition watchdog, which went on to seek feedback from rivals and users. Members of Insurance Ireland cover 90 per cent of the Irish motor vehicle insurance market. \u201cThe commission found that Insurance Ireland\u2019s final commitments will ensure market participants\u2019 access to the Insurance Link platform, and decided to make them legally binding on Insurance Ireland,\u201d the European Commission said in a statement on Thursday. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 The concessions include allowing non-members to access Insurance Link, adopting fair and non-discriminatory access criteria for all applicants from Ireland and other EU countries, it said. Insurance Ireland also promised to provide clear application procedures for membership of the organisation. \u201cIn light of concerns raised during the investigation, Insurance Ireland offered a set of commitments to allay the concerns,\u201d Insurance Ireland said. \u201cThe offer of the commitments is not an acknowledgment that Insurance Ireland has infringed competition law, and Insurance Ireland notes that the European Commission has not found that Insurance Ireland has infringed competition law.\u201d Insurance Ireland\u2019s chief executive, Moyagh Murdock, welcomed the conclusion of the investigation, saying her organisation \u201cco-operated fully and worked constructively with the European Commission\u201d throughout the process. Three inquiries The case was the last of three competition investigations that had been hanging over the Irish insurance industry in recent years. The commission opened a formal investigation three years ago into whether Insurance Ireland was operating a cartel by restricting access to the claims database, almost two years after it raided the group as part of an inquiry into a number of issues in the sector. European competition enforcers were also at that time, in 2017, looking into concerns of anticompetitive practices in the market for insuring trucks and lorries in the Republic. However, it dropped that investigation in 2019. Meanwhile, a five-year Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) investigation into allegations of insurers signalling motor premium price increases to each other ended last August with five insurers and AA Ireland, an insurance intermediary, committing to legally binding agreements to reform their internal competition compliance. None of them conceded that they had breached laws. Price signalling occurs when businesses make their competitors aware that they intend to increase prices. The end of the latest investigation on Thursday came a day ahead of the implementation of a Central Bank of Ireland ban on a widespread practice of \u201cprice walking\u201d, where motor and home insurers increase premiums for loyal customers by stealth. It means that insurers, as of July 1st, cannot charge personal consumers who are on their second or subsequent renewal a premium that is higher than what they would have charged them if they were on their first renewal.",

            "raw_text": "Public liability insurance premiums continue to rise despite a significant fall in the size of injury awards, the Alliance for Insurance Reform said on Friday in the wake of a report showing awards have fallen by an average of 40 per cent. The director of the Alliance, Peter Boland, said that motor insurance premiums are coming down, but that this is not the case with public liability insurance. He said the alliance, which campaigns for insurance reform on behalf of a range of civic and business organisations, welcomes the report from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) showing a sharp fall in the value of awards since the introduction of new guidelines by the judiciary last April. \u201cWhile we are seeing some downward movement in motor insurance premiums, the experience of SMEs, voluntary and community groups, sports and cultural organisations, and charities, is that renewals are actually increasing right now.\u201d He said the insurance sector could not have its cake and eat it. \u201cThey identified the cost of claims as the key driver of insurance costs, and this has been addressed by the Government and the judiciary.\u201d The alliance has identified 37 sectors where there are no underwriters, or only one underwriter, willing to get involved in the provision of cover, he said. The PIAB report was also welcomed by Neil McDonnell, chief executive of the small and medium-sized business organisation, Isme. He said Isme would now like to see the Government implement a provision of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 that provides for the creation of a register of the parties taking personal injury actions, in order to identify potential abuses of the system by persons who make multiple claims. He said the courts are seeing \u201cdubious, implausible, or plainly fraudulent cases\u201d being presented to the courts every week. Insurance Ireland, which represents the insurance industry, also welcomed the PIAB report but said competition law prevented it from commenting on future pricing. \u201cOur members continue to strongly support the new Guidelines and the Action Plan for Insurance Reform and believe that a more stable sector, delivered through Government reform, will reduce market volatility and bring more certainty for customers and insurers alike.\u201d \u201cInsurance Ireland is prohibited from commenting on future pricing, but we believe that meaningful reductions in award levels will lead to decreased volatility and increased competition in the market over time.\u201d It said the public liability and employer\u2019s liability section of the market remained very challenging. Other areas of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform now needed to be progressed, it said, and cited the strengthening of the powers of PIAB, the rebalancing of the duty of care between business and the citizen, and increasing competition in the market. \"It is particularly crucial that we see a strengthening of PIAB's ability to settle cases so that fewer claims go to the courts, where the legal costs add so much to the overall cost of settling claims,\" said CEO Moyagh Murdock. Pat McDonagh, the owner of Supermacs, called for the immediate reform of PIAB so that it could assess the value of all personal injury claims with recourse to the courts only on a point of law. \u201cWe are in danger of our society losing faith in the judicial system,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you from my experience that the business community certainly has.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "The huge effort that went into the creation of the Judicial Council and its adoption of guidelines on personal injury award levels has, it would appear from the latest figures released by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), been a success in so far as the driving down of award values for smaller injuries is concerned. But getting to the ultimate objective of reduced insurance premiums was always going to involve further effort. The vast majority of personal injury claims are settled between the claimant and the insurer rather than by way of PIAB or the courts. In the High Court during the week, Mr Justice Michael Twomey noted that an \"impecunious\" person who takes a personal injury claim to that court, rather than, say, the District Court, increases the pressure on the insurance company to come to a settlement, because even if the plaintiff loses, the insurer will end up out of pocket because of the legal costs it has incurred when responding to the claim. The observation about legal costs applies generally, and undoubtedly the costs involved in defending claims is one of the reasons that claims that might not succeed in court are nevertheless being settled by insurance companies. More information on the size of the settlements being made by insurers was the focus of much comment in the wake of the PIAB report showing an average 40 per cent drop in award values in the wake of the new guidelines. Are insurance companies settling cases for higher values than the Judicial Council guidelines suggest are appropriate? If they are, then maybe we can find a way to tackle that problem too. Meanwhile, motor insurance premiums are falling, while public-liability premiums, it appears, are still going in the wrong direction. That market has a dearth of underwriters and is not working properly. Given the toxic effect high premiums have on such a wide range of societal activities, there is no choice but to continue the effort to sort out this crisis.",

Ulster Bank entered a deal in 2012 to act as an intermediary for car and home insurance ultimately underwritten by Aviva. Some 15,000 of the bank\u2019s customers have such insurance policies. The transfer, which will take effect on a rolling basis from September, relates to renewal rights for car and home insurance policies which are underwritten by Aviva Insurance Ireland, for which Ulster Bank acts as insurance intermediary for Ulster Bank customers.

At that point, customers can renew the policy or seek alternative cover with another provider, as they could have done previously,\u201d it added. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement of this transfer to Aviva Direct is one more step in our phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland and I am happy to inform our customers that they don\u2019t need to do anything until their policy comes up for renewal,\u201d said Jane Howard, chief executive of Ulster Bank.",

He insisted however that the vast majority of cr\u00e8ches would re-open after the Christmas break and would have insurance coverage. Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald called for an emergency fund for creches because of concerns that a number could be forced to close if they could not get insurance. She said childcare facilities faced \u201cextortionate\u201d increases in insurance costs and parents needed assurance that children would have a place in January and that workers would have employment. The Dublin Central TD said the entire insurance sector \u201cneeds manners put on it\u201d and an over reliance on private providers of childcare had resulted in the latest crisis. Both Ms McDonald and Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said careers in childcare were not properly supported, adding that pay was low, and most of the childcare workers were women. Step in Ms McDonald said the State should step in and provide emergency insurance. The Fianna F\u00e1il leader said the Government had been aware of insurance difficulties since April but Mr Varadkar was saying he had only become aware of it on December 6th. \u201cThe Government response to date so far been very confusing, has been very slow off the mark and it is incredible the degree to which the Government has been caught by surprise.\u201d He added that the said the average family across the OECD spent 12.6per cent of income on childcare but it was 27.4 per cent in Ireland. Some 1,300 cr\u00e8ches are scrambling to get insurance but the Taoiseach said that 869 of them have been given quotes and the remainder could be dealt with in a short time. He said Allianz insurance had offered to provide cover at a cost of \u20ac60 but that there might be a \"very small number of high risk facilities\", that would not get insurance. The Taoiseach rejected Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s call for State insurance as \u201ctotally reckless\u201d and claimed it was further evidence that the party could not be trusted with the public purse. He was confident the situation was \u201cunder control\u201d and would be resolved.

            "raw_text": "A 43 per cent hike in insurance costs over two years would be tough for any company to absorb. For a \u201csmall seasonal business\u201d like Arnolds Hotel in Dunfanaghy, Co Donegal, it is \u201chugely detrimental\u201d, says Aisling Arnold, managing director of the fourth-generation family establishment. The hotel shopped around before renewing its cover at the end of October, but weak competition in the insurance market left it exposed to a higher premium at what is already \u201ca turbulent time\u201d for the hospitality sector. Arnolds, a three-star, 30-bed hotel that celebrated its centenary in 2022, is like many hotels across Ireland in that it relies on food service to sustain its revenues throughout the year. Like others in the industry, it is doing so at a time when wage costs have gone up, yet disposable incomes remain visibly strained. \u201cWhile we have seen a lull in inflation, it is still impacting on the consumer. People are being cautious,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very fine line in terms of how much you can charge on your menu or for your accommodation before customers stop coming through the door.\u201d \u201cAs an industry, we are just struggling,\u201d says Peter Wilson, general manager of Avalon House Hotel in Castlecomer, Co Kilkenny. With more than 30 years of experience in the hospitality sector, he is conscious that high insurance premiums have been a particular scourge for Irish businesses for at least 20 of them. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to be making any inroads,\u201d he says. The benefit of updated guidelines on personal injury damages, introduced three years ago, \u201cjust doesn\u2019t seem to be filtering down\u201d. Declining electric car sales: \u2018depreciation is wild at the moment\u2019 Avalon House Hotel, a four-star, 30-bed hotel, has seen its premium for public liability, employers liability and commercial property insurance rise 24 per cent over the past two years, he says. Such premium hikes represent \u201canother hurdle\u201d, exacerbating the frustrations of the sector. If there is a better premium available from another insurer at renewal time, it is usually because the excess \u2014 the sum that must be paid by the policyholder before the insurer will cover the cost of a claim \u2014 is \u201ccrazy\u201d [high]. \u201cThe market is broken, it\u2019s broken,\u201d he says. A report published this week by the Central Bank of Ireland found insurers\u2019 profits for business cover rebounded in 2021 and 2022 to profitability levels not seen since 2010 as claims cost fell relative to the premiums they charged. While the data suggests insurers barely broke even on business insurance over 14 years starting in 2009, that is of little comfort to the sectors that have endured double-digit rises in their premiums since the pandemic at a time when other operating costs have surged too. Echoing Arnold, Wilson says any moves to pass on higher costs, including insurance, are \u201ca Catch-22 situation\u201d because consumers are also being squeezed. \u201cGuests can only pay so much for a coffee, they can only pay so much for a sandwich, they can only pay so much for a steak.\u201d The Government, he concludes, is \u201cout of touch\u201d. The Irish Hotels Federation, meanwhile, has described the cost of insurance for hospitality businesses as \u201cexcessive\u201d, warning that many hotels and guest houses are now facing \u201ceye-watering increases in the cost of doing business\u201d at an uncertain time for tourism. Several cost pressures \u2014 such as the VAT rate, which reverted to 13.5 per cent last September after almost three years at 9 per cent \u2014 are within the control of the Government to alleviate, Arnold notes. \u201cI will be doing what I always do and pivoting to the best of my ability,\u201d she says. For its part, the Government \u201cjust needs to step up\u201d.

            "raw_text": "We have written about the importance of  travel insurance  on this page over many years and have a couple of stories from readers that further emphasise that point. Laura recently bought two member of her family flights to Portugal and did not take out insurance as she \u201cassumed\u201d the family members in question had it covered. \u201cI subsequently discovered they did not,\u201d she writes. Ahead of the trip one of the travelling party fell and broke a hip and was unable to travel with the break and the risk of blood clots deemed effectively ruling it out. \u201cRyanair states their policy is the do not provide refunds because the seat you booked has operated empty in your absence. They do, however, say that they may refund you the cost of your flight ticket in the form of a travel credit if you become \u2018seriously ill\u2019 and are therefore unable to travel,\u201d Laura writes. Serious illness requests are considered on a case-by-case basis at our discretion. \u201cFollowing the accident, I wrote to Ryanair and provided them with full details of the accident and the consequences of it. Despite several exchanges with Ryanair, I continue to get a response that they do not provide refunds and consider the matter closed,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have offered no evidence that they have reviewed the case or any grounds on why in their discretion they found the situation to not merit a credit being issued. I also find it extraordinary that having advised them in advance that [my family] would not be travelling, they do not seem to be under any obligation to mitigate the exposure of an empty seat.\u201d She wonders how she can get the airline to engage in \u201cwhat is a legitimate claim. The cost of the ticket was \u20ac717\u2033. We don\u2019t have much by way of good news for Laura. While she believes the claim to be legitimate, Ryanair is entirely within its rights to reject it. In our experience the airline can \u2013 and does \u2013 offer people refunds and credit in some situations including the death of a member of a travelling party or a very serious medical diagnosis but in truth, it does not have to do it and can reasonably point to a passenger\u2019s need to have travel insurance to cover themselves in scenarios such as the one outlined by Laura. [\u00a0 Pricewatch: Mismatched Lidl batteries, missing baggage and washing machine trouble \u00a0] We also heard from John Fagan who was all at sea \u2013 or at least not at sea at all \u2013 after Brittany Ferries cancelled his journey back from Bilbao. \u201cIt\u2019s cost us a lot to make alternative arrangements,\u201d he writes. \u201cI asked them what am I entitled to regarding compensation, however, they said they don\u2019t have to pay us any compensation under some EU law.\u201d He also included the correspondence from the ferry company. It said it was \u201cnot in a position to make any compensatory payment as we don\u2019t provide any refund for expenses and inconvenience caused by cancelled crossings due to adverse weather conditions... Any costs incurred as a result of the cancellation would have to be addressed to your travel insurers who may well provide cover for this kind of exigency.\u201d Again, the news we have for our reader is not great. The ferry company cancelled the crossing as a result of circumstances beyond its control \u2013 the weather. And as a result, it was not bound to compensate our reader. That does not mean, however, that it had no obligations to our reader and as with a flight cancellation it had a duty of care to our reader. According to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, if a ferry is cancelled \u2013 or delayed by more than 90 minutes \u2013 John has the right to an alternate crossing at the earliest opportunity or a refund of his ticket within seven days. The CCPC also says that he will \u201cnot be entitled to accommodation or compensation if the ferry can prove that the cancellation or delay was caused by weather conditions which would make it unsafe to sail\u201d. This is where travel insurance comes in although it would be important to make sure the policy had a cancellation or curtailment element.",

This contributed to a decline in profits across the motor insurers at a time when premiums also continued to fall. Insurance companies previously highlighted that rising costs of spare parts and labour had contributed to damage costs last year. The numbers of Irish injury and damage claims increased by 16 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, following two years in which pandemic restrictions depressed crash rates, according to National Claims Information Database (NCID) figures used for the Central Bank report published on Wednesday. Of the \u20ac548 million of total settled claims costs reported last year, 54 per cent related to injury claims and 46 per cent was down to damage costs. Half of all injury claims settled last year were resolved under personal injury guidelines that were adopted in April 2021 \u2013 up from 16 per cent for the previous year. The average cost of injury cases managed directly by insurers last year was 47 per cent below those settled against a previous set of guidelines contained in the so-called book of quantum. The average cost of cases settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) was 32 per cent lower. However, only a small number of litigated claims were settled under the guidelines \u2013 as most cases settled through this channel were filed before the recent guidelines came into effect. \u201cIt is still not possible to determine the impact of the guidelines on claims settling through litigation due to the small number of claims settling through this channel. This is important to note as 77 per cent of all injury costs were associated with litigated claims,\u201d said Robert Kelly, director of economics and statistics at the Central Bank. The average premium earned per policy fell by 7 per cent last year to \u20ac568, bringing the total decline from a peak in late 2017 to 22 per cent. Still, FBD, the only indigenous insurer in the Irish market, said in August that its motor premiums increased by 1.7 per cent in the first half of the year, \u201creflecting the increasing cost of motor damage claims, driven by increases in labour, parts and paint costs, with newer, more technologically advanced vehicles costing more to repair\u201d. Profit recorded by the motor sector declined to \u20ac159 million last year \u2013 or 12 per cent of total income \u2013 from \u20ac176 million in 2021. Last year saw 48 per cent of settled injury claims being resolved directly between insurers and injured parties, with 15 per cent being dealt with through PIAB and 37 per cent through litigation \u2013 which is by far the most-costly avenue. The previous four Central Bank reports on NCID motor figures showed how most claimants opting for litigation gained little financially and lost time compared to the PIAB channel. However, the gap widened last year \u2013 reflecting the fact that most cases settled through the litigation channel were in the system before the injury award guidelines were introduced. The average award for litigated cases where claims were for less than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 94 per cent of claimants \u2013 was \u20ac22,856 last year, with legal expenses adding \u20ac17,872 to the average total cost. The average for a PIAB settlement was \u20ac15,500, with average related legal costs amounting to \u20ac755. The average for cases settled directly with insurers was \u20ac9,754, with additional legal costs averaging \u20ac2,130. The average litigated case took 4.8 years to settle, compared to averages of 2.7 years and 1.8 for those resolved through PIAB and directly, respectively. Minister of State with responsibility for financial services Jennifer Carroll MacNeill said that she will raise the issue of litigation costs with insurers and the Law Society of Ireland.

            "raw_text": "N26, a neobank which has about 200,000 Irish customers, is expanding beyond banking into the insurance space. The digital bank is starting small with plans to offer cover for smartphones initially. But in the coming months, it said it expects to build on this with offerings to include home and life insurance. It has teamed up with German company Simpleassurance for N26 Insurance, allowing customers to purchase coverage, manage plans and initiate claims from different providers from within the N26 mobile app. Private liability insurance, home insurance, life insurance, pet insurance and coverage for bikes, electronics and other large purchases will all be added to the digital bank\u2019s offering across Europe in the coming months, it said. Co-chief executive Valentin Stalf said that, with Europeans spending more than \u20ac2,000 per person a year on insurance cover on average, the market is \"ripe for disruption\". \u201cThe new fully digital N26 Insurance promises the same simple, clear and transparent view of pricing, plans and terms and conditions that is central to N26\u2019s banking experience, presenting customers with a choice of plans from top insurers and bringing a range of best-in-class options to market,\u201d the company said. \u201cN26 Insurance is insurance made easy, helping customers save time, effort and money by allowing them to buy and pay only for what they need, on-demand, and on-the-go \u2013 all with just a few taps,\u201d it added. Founded by Mr Stalf and Maximilian Tayenthal in February 2013, the Berlin-headquartered bank now has more than seven million customers globally. It launched services in Ireland in December 2015. The business, which employs more than 1,500 people, has raised close to \u20ac800 million from backers since it was established.",

            "raw_text": "Global insurance giant Arthur J Gallagher has added another independent Irish insurance broker to its stable as the rapid consolidation of the domestic market continues. The S&P 500-listed company has acquired the Dublin-based First Ireland Risk Management in a deal that doubles the size of the group\u2019s Irish business \u201covernight\u201d, Ronan Foley, chief executive of Gallagher in Ireland, told The Irish Times. Gallagher said the deal will see First Ireland become part of its rapidly expanding UK and Ireland division, adding the Dublin firm\u2019s 35,000 customers to its 1.3 million-strong client base. The acquisition almost doubles Gallagher\u2019s gross written premiums in Ireland from \u20ac70 million to \u20ac140 million, making it one of the top five biggest brokerage groups operating in the Irish market, Mr Foley said. First Ireland\u2019s joint managing directors Tony Gill and Linda Gallagher will remain with the business, reporting to Mr Foley. Mr Foley said Gallagher is delighted to \u201cjoin forces with First Ireland\u201d, which employs more than 120 people, and offers a range of commercial and personal lines insurance as well as life and pensions products. \u201cI\u2019ve been keen on looking at [First Ireland] for a number of years,\u201d Mr Foley said, adding that the acquisition gives Gallagher \u201ca base in Dublin, which we didn\u2019t have\u201d. The deal follows  several years of unprecedented consolidation  within the Irish market, which continues to attract private equity investment. Innovu, backed by MML, had been among the main driving forces behind this trend, snapping up five independent Irish brokers, including Cullen Insurances and Wexford-based PE Kelly Insurances in October 2021 before itself being acquired by Gallagher in June. Innovu had also inked deals for Sheridan Insurances, Wexford Insurances, and Goggin Insurance Brokers. Gallagher Ireland also acquired Wexford-based broker Doyle Mahon Insurances in November 2022. The group says it now has a team of more than 275 supporting its Irish clients. Despite shifting macroeconomic sands, Mr Foley said he does not expect the pace of deal-making within the sector to slow down over the next year. \u201cI think I see another 12 months of it at least,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it falling off any time. So obviously, there will be [fewer and fewer] large targets out there. But there\u2019s still quite a lot of smaller, mid-sized brokers that are interested in how to scale their business up. And they\u2019re looking at other options for the future.\u201d Asked whether the ongoing market consolidation is good for consumers, Mr Foley said it was \u201chugely beneficial\u201d for them. \u201cIt improves the amount of compliance or regulation in the marketplace . . . because as these business consolidate you get a lot more centralised regulation.\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a benefit for customers for the businesses.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Business interruption insurance claims arising from the Covid-19 pandemic are expected to amount to \u20ac430 million, according to an estimate from industry group Insurance Ireland. The organisation said its forecast could potentially underestimate the total number of likely claims. Some \u20ac62 million in claims had been paid out to customers to date since the crisis began last year, it added. More than 9,000 business interruption claims have been received, of which more than a third have been accepted. A further 1,222 are being assessed while 3,264 did not have cover. Some 1,462 claims were withdrawn by customers. \"The Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its impact and will be one of the biggest insured events of recent times. These latest estimates demonstrate the support that Insurance Ireland members expect to offer their customers as a result of business interruption insurance-related claims across a wide range of policies. This data was collected from individual firms by Insurance Ireland in recent weeks,\" said Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of Insurance Ireland. Ms Murdock said the organisation recognised that the pandemic had illustrated some \u201cuncomfortable gaps between what people expected to be covered for and what their policy was designed for\u201d. \u201cWe need to learn lessons from this unprecedented event and redouble our efforts to improve consumers\u2019 understanding and trust in insurance products,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also understand that this is a very difficult time for businesses and that business interruption insurance is a cause of concern in the marketplace. It is a very complex issue but most policy wordings are clear in terms of what cover is provided and what exclusions are in place.\u201d FBD said in late February that it had set aside \u20ac65 million of provisions for claims and expenses arising from a landmark Covid-19 business interruption pubs test case ruling earlier that month. It put the total cost at \u20ac150 million settling claims from more than 1,000 pubs affected by the ruling, but most of it will ultimately be picked up by reinsurance companies that shared the risk.",

            "date": "2023-09-27",
            "raw_text": "Pubs, restaurants and hotels are finding it easier to source insurance and at cheaper rates as Government action on the sector takes effect, an industry specialist has said. CFM Group , a broker specialising in the  hospitality sector , says Government action is finally delivering increased competition in the sector and better insurance deals for businesses. It says there has been much more activity in the sector this year, with insurers competing for the business of hotels, pubs and restaurants. It is a trend CFM says it expects to continue. Managing director Jonathan Hehir attributes the improved environment to the new Government personal injury guidelines and a reduction in spurious claims. \u201cFor the first time in a while there\u2019s good news for the people behind Ireland\u2019s hospitality sector,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve months ago, a pub owner might only have been able to get one or two quotes \u2013 neither of which would have been considered competitive. Now many can expect to be able to choose between three or four \u2013 and sometimes as many as six\u2033. He said that reductions of 20-30 per cent in the cost of premiums on policy renewals were \u201cno longer unusual\u201d. And even businesses that had previously had to claim on their policy were no longer being treated as \u201cinsurance pariahs\u201d. \u201cJust last month we had a client whose pub insurance policy was up for renewal. The incumbent insurer offered to renew at \u20ac9,000, but another insurer that wasn\u2019t overly active in the hospitality market this time last year quoted \u20ac6,800,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother pub we worked on behalf of had been subject to a claim two years ago and was now facing a renewal quote of \u20ac15,000. We managed to secure it at \u20ac11,000 with an alternative provider\u201d. Mr Hehir said that a dearth of competition and a lack of legislative controls around personal injury claim costs in recent years had resulted in an insurance nightmare for many in the hospitality sector. The recent developments could see a change in the fortune for a sector that employs more than 200,000 people across the State, he said. The positive developments on the insurance side of the business have emerged as it comes to terms with the ending of favourable VAT treatment. A specially discounted 9 per cent rate of VAT on the hospitality sector was not extended at the end of last month, after a summer when a spotlight fell particularly on hotel room rates. Businesses in the sector have also been struggling with rising costs for energy and general supplies, as well as a shortage of labour that is putting pressure on rates of pay.",

            "date": "2023-06-20",
            "raw_text": "Like most other things it seems,  health insurance costs are rising . From July, Irish Life Health will impose its second price increase since the start of the year, in a move that will increase the annual cost of some family policies by more than \u20ac400. And where one insurer goes, others are likely to follow. So, isn\u2019t it time to get the best value out of your private insurance policy if you are among the one-in-two people in Ireland with one? While most of us would prefer cheaper insurance premiums and cover for the essentials \u2013 rather than any extras \u2013 it still makes sense to get the most out of what you\u2019re currently paying for. Indeed, you may be adept at claiming money back for a visit to your GP, or the dentist (penurious as the latter may be), but many of us fail to claim a host of other benefits, many of which are added without us even realising. Here we give you some ideas of what you might not be claiming for. Just remember to watch out for a potential excess on your policy \u2013 you don\u2019t want to get a discretionary treatment only to later discover that you need \u20ac200 in claims before you will actually start to benefit. And make sure you check with your insurer that you are covered, before you avail of any of the following. \u2018Beauty\u2019 treatments With summer holidays ramping up, having your feet in decent nick is a concern for men and women alike. While a traditional pedicure in a beauty salon will cost upwards of about \u20ac50/\u20ac60 \u2013 and effectiveness can vary \u2013 a medical pedicure can deliver much the same, with a greater level of expertise. At The FootCareClinic, for example, which has branches in Donnycarney and Palmerstown in Dublin, a medi-pedi involves cleaning the feet and toenails, trimming and polishing nails, and if necessary, removing calluses, corns and ingrown nails. Removing any lingering dead skin, and hydrating the feet, is also part of the treatment. Not only that, you can also get your nails painted \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to bring your own polish. In Limerick, you can get a medi-pedi with The Footcare Clinic for just \u20ac35. And, depending on your insurance policy, you may be entitled to up to half of this back. Irish Life, for example, offers 50 per cent back on podiatrist visits for up to 12 visits a year, on a number of its plans, while with VHI, you can get up to 75 per cent back per visit, on the insurer\u2019s PMI 17 10 plan. Or what about a massage? A full body massage with Calm Beauty in Drumcondra costs \u20ac95 for 90 minutes. And, as members of the Irish Massage Therapists Association (IMTA), you may be eligible for an insurance refund. Irish Life, for example, offers benefits on a number of its plans for massage therapy. For example, members of its 4D Health 3 plan can now get 50 per cent back on the costs of up to 12 massages a year, as long as the therapist is a member of the IMTA. This could bring the aforementioned massage down to just \u20ac47.50 \u2013 a fair comparison when you could easily spend more than \u20ac100 on a similar massage in a beauty salon. You may also find that you qualify for money back on a sports massage. [\u00a0 Health insurance: How to save up to \u20ac1,000 a year on your plan \u00a0] Teeth whitening is another popular cosmetic treatment. With Laya Healthcare, you can get a discount of 10 per cent on the procedure (currently costing \u20ac99) at White Smile Clinic in both Dublin and Cork. Irish Life Health offers a 20 per cent discount on treatments with The White House, which brings the cost of a 45-minute treatment down to \u20ac116. VHI offers a \u20ac50 discount on at-home whitening treatments. It is also possible to get a discount on laser hair removal, as Irish Life offers a \u20ac25 discount on such facial treatments. Just keep your receipts and claim in the normal way. If you\u2019re hoping for a \u201crefresh\u201d to your face, however, you\u2019ll have to pay top dollar. VHI, Laya and Irish Life all say that cosmetic procedures such as Botox are not covered (unless for certain medically necessary procedures), while if you attend a dermatologist for fillers or facelifts, you won\u2019t get cover. Again, procedures with dermatologists are only covered if they are medically necessary the insurer says \u2013 although as it\u2019s not always clear if this is the case, then you might find that a consultation to discuss anti-ageing procedures etc may be covered. Designer sunglasses Through a combination of the State\u2019s optical benefits plan, which allows you to get a free eye test, plus money towards a pair of glasses once every two years \u2013 currently \u20ac42.37 \u2013 and your insurance cover, you may be able to secure a pair of designer sunglasses at a considerable discount. This is because when you buy sunglasses through Specsavers or Opticalrooms, for example, (even if they have no prescription in them), many insurers will offer you a fixed amount back on your total expenditure. On some plans, VHI offers 75 per cent of charges, up to \u20ac150, back on glasses once every two years. And as some opticians, such as Specsavers, offer further incentives on the sale of sunglasses when buying prescription glasses, the savings can add up. Sports stuff Insurers have also stepped up what they offer in terms of sports, wellness and fitness benefits. Laya, for example, has a digital gym service, which is available to all members aged over 16. It gives them access to more than 20 online classes a week, including Pilates, yoga and HIIT. The insurer says it sees \u201cstrong digital demand\u201d for services such as these. Irish Life, meanwhile, offers payments of up to \u20ac100 on the cost of your annual sports club fee. So, if you\u2019re a member of a gym, GAA club or soccer club (or your kids are), don\u2019t forget to claim this as soon as you pay your annual fees. Depending on your plan, you may also get up to \u20ac60 a year for yoga and Pilates classes. Elsewhere, VHI gives its members their entry fee back for the  VHI Women\u2019s Mini Marathon , while at its 360 Health Centre in Carrickmines, yoga and Pilates are offered as a part of a follow-on package. You may be surprised to learn that if you\u2019re in the market for a so-called \u201cwearable tracker\u201d, such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch, you may be entitled to some money back. With Irish Life, for example, you can get up to \u20ac50 back on the cost, while Laya advises members to check their policies, as it too offers money back on such tech. Irish Life also offers 50 per cent back on the cost of a foam roller, up to \u20ac30, as well as a host of other protective sports stuff, such as a fitted gum shield, hurling helmet, shin guards etc. And Irish Life offers \u20ac25 per session with a personal trainer, for up to three visits. Travel insurance On the one hand, it\u2019s a nice added benefit, to get your travel needs covered at the same time as your health insurance policy, at no extra cost. Irish Life offers free travel cover with Mapfre Assistance on some of its policies. The difficulty is perhaps, that first, the policy may not be sufficient to meet your needs, as often, you\u2019ll find that it is only adults on the policy that benefit, as they are more likely to have the more expensive policies that offer this. And, as adults will need to be on a policy with a child, it means that you can\u2019t just get another policy in your children's\u2019 name only. [\u00a0 A tragic story that shows why you should buy travel insurance as soon as you book a trip \u00a0] VHI doesn\u2019t offer this incentive \u2013 while all of its plans have emergency medical cover abroad up to \u20ac100,000, you\u2019ll have to take out separate cover for your flights, baggage etc. Laya also offers this cover, as well as a 20 per cent discount for anyone taking out their travel insurance with Laya Travel via its website.",

Approximately 12 million EU citizens have reached long-term recovery and the number is rising by around 3 per cent each year. And yet many of those who have recovered face discrimination in accessing financial services. Financial penalties should not be an additional burden; they unjustly interfere with rehabilitation and are often associated with unnecessary psychological harm. In 2016, legislation was introduced in France to establish the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d for former cancer patients when seeking a mortgage, financial loan or insurance. In subsequent years, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Cyprus and, most recently, Italy have also passed this right into law. The insurance industry in five EU countries, including Ireland, introduced a voluntary code of practice to end such discrimination. Concerns exist that acceptance of this non-binding code will lead to delay in the legislative process that should be applied in all member states in the EU. The path toward legislation in Ireland requires renewed and urgent collaborative dialogue with the insurance industry.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Outcomes for patients with cancer are improving constantly with progressively increased survival rates. Waiting times for former patients before they can obtain access to normal financial services without weighting of premiums should be assessed in the light of contemporary evidence. At a conference in Brussels last month attended by patients, commissioners, MEPs, state ministers, physicians, surgeons, scientists, researchers, lawyers, advocacy groups and representatives of the insurance industry and cancer organisations, a unanimous recommendation was reached for concerted action supporting EU-wide legislation for the right to be forgotten for people who have recovered from cancer. This issue deserves the attention of all candidates in forthcoming national and European elections. It\u2019s not about compassion; it\u2019s about justice. \u2013 Yours, etc, NIALL O\u2019HIGGINS, (Professor Emeritus of Surgery, University College Dublin), Dublin 4.",

            "raw_text": "Customers of Irish Life Health are to be hit with price increases averaging 5 per cent from the beginning of July. The increase, which is the second to be rolled out by the company since the start of the year, will see some family policies climb by between \u20ac160 and \u20ac220 and could mark a return to double-digit price hikes, according to one health insurance expert. It will impact Irish Life Health customers renewing their polices from July 1st, and when the latest increase is added to the earlier price rise it could see the cost of some family policies climb by over \u20ac400. The company said it was increasing its premiums as a result of \u201ca very significant increase in the volume and size of claims\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s an eye-opener\u2019: The Irish medics training Ukrainian lawyers, vets and photographers to help the war effort \u2018It\u2019s an eye-opener\u2019: The Irish medics training Ukrainian lawyers, vets and photographers to help the war effort It said that post-pandemic, \u201cthere has been a considerable ramp-up in activity across all public and private health services, with private and high-tech hospitals returning to full service and many much-needed procedures that had been deferred during the pandemic now taking place. The level of claims in 2022 from private and high-tech hospitals is the highest seen since the inception of Irish Life Health in 2016\u201d. It also pointed to a \u201cgeneral inflationary environment seen in the economy\u201d and said that \u201csubstantial medical and general inflation has materialised over the last three years in the form of higher hospital costs and consultant fees. The company also said there were increased requirements for high-cost pharmaceuticals to deliver the best health outcomes for patients. VHI and Laya have also increased their rates this year with the former increasing the average annual policy by an average of 4.8 per cent in March, and the latter upping its prices by an average of 4.4 per cent in April. \u201cWe can only assume that they will move on their rates again later in the year assuming they\u2019re affected by the same cost drivers [claims] as Irish Life Health,\u201d said Dermott Goode of Total Health Cover. \u201cAfter a period of relative price stability for health insurance, we\u2019re returning to the days of potentially double-digit price hikes which will be unaffordable for many households,\u201d he said He said that the main reason for both of these increases has been the high level of claims being received. In particular, the latest price hike seems to be driven by a significant increase in claims coming through private and high-tech hospitals. \u201cWhen looking at this, customers need to be mindful ... that the impact on their premium could actually be higher than the average increases quoted. We understand that some of the lower-level schemes will be increasing by 1 to 2 per cent, some of the newer plans by around 2 to 3 per cent, but most schemes by an average of 5 per cent,\u201d Mr Goode noted. \u201cThese hikes could force people to reconsider the need for private cover (especially younger members). It could also force those who are using their cover to take on more risk in the form of higher policy excesses or reduced overall cover in an effort to keep the cost affordable.\u201d Mr Goode said that for hard-pressed consumers \u201cwho will struggle to absorb these latest increases, there is no real alternative to private cover as the public system continues to struggle with waiting lists\u201d. He cautioned people against auto renewing policies. and not to \u201caccept these price hikes without completing a full review of your options\u201d. \u201cThere are over 330 plans to choose from and those who shop around properly can usually manage to keep their costs affordable whilst still maintaining quality cover.\u201d Irish Life Health managing director Ger Davis said the company was \u201cacutely aware of the impact increasing premiums will have on our customers. We recognise that these changes will be difficult for customers who have recently experienced significant price increases across many areas\u201d. He said the company had tried to keep the increases \u201cas low as possible in the context of the increased cost of providing the healthcare that our customers are accessing. \u201cAs pent-up demand for medical services makes its way through a more normalised health system, the volume of claims is higher than previously anticipated.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "About 130,000  VHI  members will be forced to change their healthcare cover, with the insurer set to axe some of its most popular plans next month. The plans VHI is to withdraw are its Health Plus Extra plan (\u20ac3,400 per adult); Health Plus Access (\u20ac2,574 per adult); Health Plus Excess (\u20ac2,471 per adult); and Health Access (\u20ac2,276 per adult). The plans will no longer be available to new members or renewals from May 1st. A spokeswoman for the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) said there are about 130,000 people \u2013 more than one in 10 of all VHI customers \u2013 across the four plans being closed. The change will impact VHI members who have remained on these plans \u2013 formerly know as Plan B, Plan B Options and Plan B Excess \u2013 over many years. VHI is Ireland\u2019s largest health insurance provider with 1.1 million customers. Health insurance expert Dermot Goode of  totalhealthcover.ie  said the \u201csurprise move\u201d will be of \u201cparticular concern\u201d to older members who renewed on these plans to retain full cover for major orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures. \u201cThey will have no option now but to shop around for alternative cover from their next renewal date,\u201d he said. Many of those currently on the plans being taken off the market are likely to be signed up through employer group schemes, Mr Goode said. \u201cThey also need to review their options as a matter of urgency. \u201cWhilst these plans offer good cover, some have been on the market for nearly 30 years and are therefore very expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last 12 months alone, customers on these plans have been hit with significant price hikes.\u201d A spokeswoman for VHI said the aim of the move was to deliver \u201ca simplified product structure and enhanced offerings to better meet member\u2019s needs\u201d. \u201cThis means closing some of our older plans and moving some of our members on to different plans that better meet their healthcare needs,\u201d she said, adding this would be done on a \u201crenewal-by-renewal basis\u201d. \u201cCurrently there are more than 350 plans on the market, and we believe that the number of plans might be overwhelming consumers and making it more difficult to shop around,\u201d the spokeswoman for the HIA said. \u201cFor this reason, we encourage plan closures, and we welcome the news that VHI have decided to close four of their plans.\u201d The State-owned health insurer slipped into the red last year as the cost of claims jumped by 18 per cent and it experienced higher labour and energy costs and a strong increase in demand for healthcare services. This resulted in the company recording a net deficit or loss of \u20ac43.4 million, compared with a net surplus or profit of \u20ac34.3 million in 2022. The company\u2019s annual results show that it recorded a 3.2 per cent increase in premium income last year and saw its customer base climb by more than 37,000. The insurer raised premium prices twice last year, by an average of over 12 per cent. It announced a further 7 per cent average rise in premiums last month. Mr Goode said there are similar alternatives available from VHI, such as their Advanced Care product range, but he warned members to be careful they are not transferred to more expensive options. He said many VHI members affected by the withdrawal of these plans \u201cmay be inclined to just accept the alternative\u201d offered by VHI. \u201cWe would urge all members not to autorenew on whatever is offered by VHI, but to take this opportunity to check all options across the market first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may be shocked to find they can source equivalent cover at a lower cost. For those fearful of change, seek help from a trusted friend or family member or engage a qualified broker to do this review work for you. [\u00a0 Health insurance: How to side-step the dizzying complexity of changing plans or provider and save yourself thousands \u00a0] In terms of engaging with VHI or the other insurers, he said it is important to always contact the company by phone to discuss options as all calls are recorded. \u201cDo this well in advance of your renewal to give yourself plenty of time,\u201d he said. \u201cDecide on your budget for health cover before you contact them and challenge them to find you the closest equivalent plan that fits this budget. If you\u2019re talking to a new health insurer, disclose everything to them: current plan, medical history, planned treatments, etc. \u201cWhatever alternatives they offer, have them explain exactly how these compare to your existing cover so you understand all plan differentials. If you\u2019re still not sure or if you\u2019re confused by all the options, seek independent advice before making your final decision.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

            "date": "2022-05-25",
            "raw_text": "The ongoing high cost of insurance is threatening the future of more than 40 per cent of commercial and voluntary organisations in the State, the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been told. Addressing the committee on Wednesday, the Alliance for Insurance Reform said a recent survey of its member policyholders had found that since the implementation of new judicial guidelines for damage claims, insurance premiums have actually risen by 16 per cent overall. Alliance director Peter Boland told TDs and Senators the alliance has more than 55,000 members which employ 700,000 people, while also representing 622,000 volunteers and 374,000 students. Mr Boland said the members\u2019 response to a survey to mark the first anniversary of the new judicial guidelines was stark. He said while 42 per cent of respondents felt the cost of insurance was threatening their future, 31 per cent said insurance costs were preventing them from providing additional services \u2014 a rise from 26 per cent in a similar survey of members undertaken in 2018. Belfast has received no contact from Dublin over asylum seekers crossing Border into Republic, O\u2019Neill says Belfast has received no contact from Dublin over asylum seekers crossing Border into Republic, O\u2019Neill says Mr Boland said it should be noted that the 16 per cent increase in premiums since the judicial guidelines were introduced was on top of \u201csavage increases\u201d experienced by many policyholders each year since 2017. He said the most recent survey also showed 73 per cent of organisations have had additional excesses or exclusions imposed on their policies since 2019. Mr Boland described these as \u201dstealth increases\u201d, and said some 90 per cent of respondents to the survey felt the Government \u201cis not doing enough to address the issue of insurance costs\u201d. He said while reforms undertaken to date were having an impact on private motor premiums, which the survey showed have dropped about 9 per cent since May of last year, \u201cthey are not having an impact on the liability premiums paid by businesses, voluntary and community groups, sports and cultural organisations and charities\u201d. Mr Boland agreed with Insurance Ireland that one of the major issues in the industry was the costs imposed by some members of the legal profession. He said claimants should be made aware that going to court often resulted in a claimant getting less compensation. He said the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) makes average compensation awards to plaintiffs of \u20ac26,760, with average legal fees of \u20ac1,705. However, he said claimants \u201cwho listen to their solicitor\u2019s advice\u201d, and reject the PIAB assessment, wait a further 2.7 years on average for compensation and get \u20ac1,672 less through the courts. \u201cThe only beneficiaries of this extended process are lawyers, who get an average of \u20ac18,680 in fees, 11 times more than the cost of delivering compensation through PIAB,\u201d he said. Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of Insurance Ireland, told the Committee Government proposals to reform the PIAB as part of a new Bill were strongly supported by Insurance Ireland. She said for premiums to reduce two issues must change; the large-scale legal costs associated with court compensation awards and the amount of responsibility allocated to premises owners in the case of personal injury claims.",

The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) which was published last month. Susan had private health insurance. She needed a particular medical procedure and wanted to have it in a particular private hospital. \u201cHer health insurer asked her for the procedure code of the treatment as she was covered for some procedures in that hospital, but not all,\u201d the report says. \u201cWhen her health insurer checked the code, it was on a list of limited treatments covered by Susan\u2019s policy in that hospital, so the treatment went ahead, and the claim paid.\u201d One of the things this page is always telling people to do is review their health cover regularly and that is what Susan did. She decided to switch her policy to one she felt \u201ccovered benefits that were of more use to her, and which reduced the cost\u201d. Later that year Susan became ill. \u201cHer GP told her to attend A&E. Susan decided to attend the A&E in the particular private hospital in which she had been treated before, as her medical records were there along with her treating consultant.\u201d On that day, Susan was given a test which led to a medical intervention which cost about \u20ac10,000. Susan\u2019s claim was not paid as she had not noticed that she was not covered for this particular hospital under her new policy. Susan had assumed she was covered due to having previously been covered for a procedure in the same hospital. \u201cSusan thought it was very unfair that she had to think of issues like this when she was in the middle of a medical emergency,\u201d the report says. When call recordings were examined it emerged that the insurer had previously given warnings about changes in cover and the need to check every procedure code before seeking treatment. \u201cSusan accepted that she was not covered for this treatment and decided to take the issue up with the hospital, as she had no recollection of the hospital ever advising her to check her cover before treatment.

Egidijus Aleliunas (43) operated as a so-called \u2018ghost broker\u2019 from 2010 until 2017 by buying legitimate policies online using false information and forged no claims bonuses. He advertised his service on Facebook and sold policies to people who could not get insurance or to those who wanted it cheaper than the quotes they received. Aleliunas charged a fee to these individuals, the vast majority of whom believed him to be a legitimate broker, the court heard. Aleliunas of The Paddocks Way, Adamstown, Lucan, pleaded guilty to multiple counts including deception, possession of false documents, use of a false instrument and possessing and transferring the proceeds of criminal conduct over a seven-year period. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 His wife, Anastasija Pavola (37), father-in-law Viaceslav Pavlov (68) and mother-in-law Natalja Pavlova (65) each pleaded guilty to engaging in the transfer of property that was the proceeds of crime between June and August 2017. Dublin Circuit Criminal Court heard that these three entered guilty pleas on the basis of recklessness as they allowed their bank accounts to be used to transfer money to an investment company in Dubai. They had no involvement in the \u2018ghost brokerage\u2019 business. Neither Aleliunas nor his three co-accused have any previous convictions. Imposing sentence, Judge Martin Nolan said Aleliunas was a \u201cserious and industrious man who found a way to make illicit money\u201d by identifying a gap in the market. He said Aleliunas \u201cmanufactured\u201d applications to the insurance companies which resulted in them offering insurance policies on a certain basis, which turned out to be false. Imposing a custodial sentence of five years, Judge Nolan said Aleliunas is a \u201cvery competent man\u201d who \u201ccan change and reform himself and be good member of society if he wants to\u201d. He handed Pavola, also of The Paddocks; Pavlov - of Earlsfort Road, Lucan; and Pavlova, of Abbeydale Gardens, Lucan, a suspended two-year sentence each. Detective Sergeant John Casey of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau told Grainne O\u2019Neill BL, prosecuting, that an investigation started in 2017 after Aviva noticed a number of no claims bonuses signed by the same person, referred to in court as \u2018BC\u2019. However, BC had only ever signed one such document, which was issued to Aleliunas in 2010. Seven insurance companies including Allianz, First Ireland and Liberty were affected, with 34 sample car insurance policies reviewed during the investigation. Of these sample policies, 23 policyholders paid Aleliunas in cash. The insurance companies have linked 236 insurance policies to Aleliunas, who initially used his own name, then later an alias \u2018Thomas Vudkas\u2019. Aleliunas was also working as a security guard during this period. Garda\u00ed identified that Aleliunas had 11 bank accounts associated with him, including two in the name of Thomas Vudkas. Of these 11 accounts, only one had a legitimate source of income. \u20ac182,000 was seized from a number of bank accounts. Eight cars and six watches with a value of \u20ac126,000 and \u20ac4,000 cash were also seized. Aleliunas invested around \u20ac50,000 in cryptocurrency while \u20ac80,000 was transferred to an investment company in Dubai. Pavola, Pavlov and Pavlova each allowed their bank accounts to be used to transfer between \u20ac18,000 and \u20ac20,000 between June and August 2017 to Dubai on behalf of Aleliunas. John Byrne SC, for Aleliunas, told the court his client is anxious to take full responsibility and wishes to distance his family from the offending. Det Sgt Carey agreed with Mr Byrne that his client exercised his right to silence about the ghost brokerage during interview, but provided valuable information. It was further agreed that when multiple versions of the no claims bonus signed by BC appeared, this helped the insurance companies to \u201csmell a rat\u201d. The witness agreed that Aleliunas is not suspected of involvement in organised crime or other criminal activities. It was also accepted that his plea was valuable to the prosecution. Mr Byrne suggested that some of the policyholders were aware that Aleliunas was not a legitimate broker. Det Sgt Carey said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to think that none were aware, but the majority genuinely believed it was legitimate. Det Sgt Carey agreed with Eoghan Cole SC, defending Pavola that her role was limited to allowing her account be used as a vehicle for the transfer of money. It was further accepted that she has a good work history and runs a compliant and legitimate beauty business. He agreed with defence counsel for Pavlov and Pavlova that they had no obvious trappings of wealth, good work histories and no previous convictions. All four of the accused are originally from Lithuania. Mr Byrne asked the court to take into account that his client was the one who came up with the scam which \u201cspiralled out of control\u201d. He said his client was the \u201cmain player\u201d and had taken an \u201chonourable stance\u201d in relation to the case. A number of references were handed into the court. Mr Byrne said his client is from a \u201cvery modest background who suddenly found himself in position to gain easy money\u201d and bought things he didn\u2019t need. His client has accepted that the seized goods and cash will be forfeited. His instructions are that Aleliunas\u2019s investments in cryptocurrency were unsuccessful. Aleliunas is remorseful and has been suffering with anxiety and depression in the run-up to the sentencing date. Mr Byrne suggested this was a \u201cdeception case which generated money\u201d and there was no suggestion that his client is involved in organised crime. In sentencing, Judge Nolan said Aleliunas accumulated \u201cquite a lot of wealth\u201d over a number of years. Judge Nolan said he inferred it was likely that there were \u201cmultiples\u201d of the 236 policies identified by the insurance companies. He said he considered the guilty plea, lack of previous convictions, work history and co-operation with the investigation as mitigation. Judge Nolan noted the other three defendants have good work histories, no previous convictions and all were asked by Aleliunas to transfer money abroad. He said they should have been \u201cmore careful\u201d and were \u201csomewhat reckless\u201d, but he added that the court considered it would be unjust to imprison them. He handed Pavola, Pavlova and Pavlov a two-year suspended sentence each. Judge Nolan also agreed not to disqualify Pavola as a director because it would close her business.

            "raw_text": "The industry body for Irish insurance brokers has launched an unprecedented attack against the State\u2019s competition authority over the outcome of a long-running investigation into anti-competitive behaviour in the motor insurance industry between 2015 and 2016, as coverage costs soared. A five-year Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) investigation into allegations of insurers signalling motor premium price increases to each other ended last August with five insurers and AA Ireland, an insurance intermediary, committing to legally binding agreements to reform their internal competition compliance. None of them conceded that they breached laws. Price signalling occurs when businesses make their competitors aware that they intend to increase prices. Brokers Ireland refused to sign up to a CCPC-overseen compliance agreement. In its final report on the investigation, published on Tuesday, the CCPC said the industry body\u2019s stance \u201carguably calls into question the importance that organisation puts on demonstrating compliance with competition law and sends an unhelpful message to those organisations it represents\u201d. However, Brokers Ireland, formed in 2017 through the merger of the Irish Brokers Association (IBA) and another group, responded by accusing the CCPC to \"spiteful commentary intended to blacken and sully the reputation of an organisation that had the courage to stand up to it\". It said it rejected \u201cunreasonable and unwarranted compliance demands\u201d the watchdog sought to impose on it, after failing to prove any instances of anti-competitive practices against the IBA during the period under investigation. Public announcements The CCPC responded by highlighting that its preliminary findings, issued in September 2020, alleged that the IBA was involved in making public announcements between 2015 and 2016 about industry-wide premium trends, engaging in discussions with an unnamed insurer on motor coverage increases, and facilitating contact between a number of insurers to discuss price hikes. The authority said it remained \"disappointed\" that Brokers Ireland did not follow individual insurers subject to the investigation \u2013 including Axa, Allianz, Aviva, AIG Ireland and FBD \u2013 in signing up to legally binding competition compliance programme agreements. Brokers Ireland said, however, the IBA\u2019s press commentary on pricing during the period under investigation was \u201cdeliberately mischaracterised\u201d by the authority as price announcements, when they were often responses to media requests on pricing trends. Motor insurance premiums soared more than 70 per cent over three years before they peaked in 2016, according to data from the Central Statistics Office. Costs have since declined. Insurers put the price increases at the time down to their efforts to recover sharp losses over a number of years amid rising claims and court awards. The stand-off between Brokers Ireland and the CCPC underscores shortcomings in Irish law that the Government is seeking to address, following years of lobbying from competition officials. The CCPC had three options under the existing regime: close the investigation without taking any action; settle it by entering a commitment agreement with parties involved; or seek a High Court declaration that competition laws had been breached. The CCPC said the alleged conduct ceased as it began its investigation in late 2016, meaning there would have been little benefit for consumers in pursuing litigation. The Cabinet only last month gave the green light for draft laws to give the CCPC the power to impose administrative sanctions. The Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022 proposes maximum fines of up to \u20ac10 million or 10 per cent of total worldwide turnover, whichever is the greater, for anti-competitive practices.",

Alexander Afanaschenko, 45,of Bewley Drive, in Lucan, Mikhail Yegorov, 38, of Charnwood Court, Clonsilla and Elena Olenik, 44, who lives in Berryfield, Finnstown, Lucan, Dublin were remanded on bail after they appeared before Judge Gerard Jones at Blanchardstown District Court on Thursaday. It follows an investigation by the Garda Special Investigations Unit in Roads Policing Division based at Dublin Castle. In excess of 2,500 motor insurance policies, valued \u20ac6m, were identified as having been fraudulently obtained from 10 insurance companies, Judge Jones was told. The Director of Public Prosecutions directed trial on indictment in the Circuit Court. The three defendants, who have not yet indicated how they will plead, were ordered to appear again in July to be served with books of evidence and returned for trial. Garda George Thurlow told the court it was alleged Mr Afanaschenko was a director of a named company which operated as a \u201cghost broker\u201d from January 2013 until September 2018. He faced 210 charges: one count of fraudulent trading contrary to the Companies Act; 76 deception charges as well as 91 for money launder offences and the rest were for using false documentation. Fraudulent documents were used get policies with beneficial premiums, it was alleged. Mr Afanaschenko, from Russia but who has lived in Ireland for 18 years, was the holder of Irish, Moldovan and Russian passports. There was no objection to bail with conditions. Mikhail Yegorov was from Ukraine but identified as Irish and has lived here since 2014, the court heard. Garda Sergeant John Carey said Mr Yegorov was accused of 21 money laundering offences by possessing proceeds of criminal conduct, and one charge of fraudulent trading of a ghost broker venture. It was alleged he worked with Mr Afanaschenko but the co-accused was more directly involved. It was alleged they were paid to use false information, including fake licences and no claims bonus certificates, to get genuine insurance policies with reduced premiums. The court heard \u20ac180,000 allegedly went through a bank account over two years. The two businessmen had bail set with \u20ac5,000 lodgements and their legal aid applications were deferred. Judge Jones ordered them to sign on regularly at their local Garda stations, to surrender travel documentation, alert gardai if they will be away from their homes for more than 24 hours, not to leave the jurisdiction, and have no contact with injured parties. Self-employed art teacher Elena Olenik, originally from Latvia, faces 15 money laundering charges and 20 counts of forgery of documents, Garda Thurlow said. Her solicitor Wayne Kenny said she is currently on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. She was granted legal aid.",

The insurer said all staff, including its senior leadership team, will continue to work from home once the pandemic has passed, with the option of spending up to two days per week in the office to carry out specific activities or hold face-to-face meetings. Liberty's decision to go fully remote mirrors recent moves by other companies such as Salesforce and Spotify to allow employees to choose ways of working that best suits them. The insurer, which announced a \u20ac100 million cloud-based technology investment in the business last year as it looks to become a fully digital organisation, said the remote working model would apply to almost 2,000 employees in Europe, with staff working in Spain and Portugal also impacted. All remote employees are to receive a \u20ac660 gross annual payment to cover additional expenses. Staff will not be able to work outside their country of employment, and are expected to continue to work their contracted hours. \"This decision supports our core values as an organisation, as well as our employees' work-life balance. It is also a further step towards the cloud business model that we launched and started to build towards before the pandemic, and which will culminate in 2024,\" said Juan Miguel Estallo, chief executive of Liberty Europe. Expectations \u201cEqually this is a response to what our employees are asking for. Through surveys to measure their experience, Liberty employees have told us that 93 per cent of the workforce does not want to return to the pre-pandemic in-office working model. Therefore we want to put people first, be more efficient and respond to the expectations of flexibility required.\u201d Headquartered in Boston, US, but with significant operations in Dublin, Cavan and Fermanagh, Liberty is the sixth largest global property and casualty insurer with revenues of $43.9 billion last year. It employs 45,000 people in 29 countries. Liberty Insurance entered the Irish market in 2011 by taking over the main businesses of Quinn Insurance. It quit its commercial liability and commercial property lines locally last year, but still has a 10 per cent market share for motor policies.",

            "raw_text": "Closure of a popular Co Wicklow adventure centre has been characterised by the operator as as \u201csoul destroying\u201d. Squirrel\u2019s Scramble had been running high ropes and zip line courses on the grounds of Killruddery House since 2014 and the decision to close has been blamed on a more than three-fold increase in their insurance premium. Last year liability insurance for Squirrel\u2019s Scramble was \u20ac26,000. But marketing director Anthea Langsaid their insurers have since left the Irish market and the lowest quote they can get for this year is \u20ac88,000. She and her husband, Chris, ran the park together. \u201cThis is our baby, it\u2019s like a fourth child. Our blood, sweat and tears went into it. It\u2019s like a bereavement.\u201d The park\u2019s last day in operation was Saturday. \u201cKids get so empowered from doing these challenges . . . the place was so full of laughter; it\u2019s so empty now.\u201d This is \u201csoul destroying,\u201d she said. Ms Lang said Squirrel\u2019s Scramble had never had a claim in relation to any of the activities, but they have had claims in relation to people falling while walking on the grounds. Ms Lang said the responsibility for safety needs to lie with the individual. \u201cThis type of thing happens in forests too, but you can\u2019t sue the trees.\u201d Hopes to reopen She believes urgent reform is needed, otherwise more businesses will close. Squirrel\u2019s Scramble is hopeful that they can reopen in April, if the cost of insurance reduces. Peter Boland, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, said while there has been change in relation to insurance, premiums are not coming down quickly enough. New judicial guidelines, which were introduced in April, have resulted in a reduction in compensation payments for minor injuries, according to Mr Boland. Secondary changes, such as making prosecution for perjury easier and the establishment of an insurance fraud unit within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, will also help. However, these reforms have not yet brought down the cost of insurance, especially liability insurance, according to Mr Boland. \u201cThere have been individual cases where the cost of premiums have gone up significantly, despite all the reforms. There are many sectors which can\u2019t get cover, or the cost of cover is unsustainable.\u201d There is still not enough competition in the Irish insurance market, which the Government needs to resolve, added Mr Boland. Insurance Ireland said that liability insurance remains challenging due to the \u201cvolatility and unpredictability\u201d of the personal injuries claims environment. It added that they support the new personal injuries guidelines and are starting to see some positive effects in latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. They are also hopeful that similar data will emerge from the courts system.",

New guidelines for damages in personal injury cases came into effect this weekend and reduced award levels may now apply for any cases that have not yet been assessed by the State\u2019s awards body. The personal injuries guidelines came into effect on Saturday after Ms McEntee signed a commencement order to give effect to the changes. The guidelines set out the level of damages that may be awarded or assessed for personal injuries. Book of Quantum They will apply to all new cases that have not yet been assessed by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). Litigants who have previously refused offers from PIAB and opted to go to court will have their claims processed in line with the Book of Quantum, a list of types of injury that gives an indication of the level of compensation likely to be awarded in respect of that particular injury. Ms McEntee said the new guidelines would take into account \u201cboth the urgency in tackling high insurance costs and fairness for those who have suffered injury as well as those who are required to defend a claim\u201d. \u2018Desired effect\u2019 \u201cI hope the new guidelines will have an impact on the award of damages in personal injuries cases and that the insurance companies will follow through and bring down the cost of insurance, which is important for individual consumers, businesses and community groups across the country.\u201d She said the Government would \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the implementation and impact of the guidelines \u201cin order to ensure they are having the desired effect\u201d. The guidelines reduce award levels for most categories of personal injury, and will be used by both the PIAB and the courts to assess compensation in such claims. The Book of Quantum will continue to apply where PIAB assessments have been made or where a hearing is already before the courts. The Judicial Council adopted the guidelines in March.",

            "author": "Mary Carolan; Joe Brennan",
            "date": "2024-04-09",
            "raw_text": "Insurers have come under fresh pressure from the Government and business lobby groups to cut premiums after the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that judged-approved guidelines, reducing awards for mainly minor personal injuries, have legal effect. Ministers of State Jennifer Carroll MacNeill and Dara Calleary said in a joint statement that \u201cinsurers have a responsibility to reflect this in their premiums\u201d. They added that legal costs in relation to personal injury claims need to be monitored. The Alliance for Insurance Reform, which represents 46 businesses and civic organisations in the State, also welcomed the landmark ruling. \u201cInsurers have said that the uncertainty caused by the Delaney case has been a big factor in limiting their ability to reduce premiums based on the new guidelines,\u201d said Padraig Cribbin, chair of the alliance. \u201cToday\u2019s decision dispels this uncertainty and must lead immediately to substantial and sustained reductions in insurance premiums across all sectors of society.\u201d The ruling was on a challenge that had been mounted by a woman from Co Waterford, Bridget Delaney, who had sought to have the guidelines, which were introduced in 2021, set aside. The Injuries Resolution Board (IRB), formerly the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, reported a 34 per cent decline in average awards in 2022, the first full year of the guidelines, compared to those under the previous so-called Book of Quantum. [\u00a0 Finding that guidelines slashing personal injury awards has legal effect \u2018of systemic importance\u2019 - Supreme Court \u00a0] Still, concerns over the Delaney test case have affected claims settlement rates \u2013 and left cases going through litigation in limbo \u2013 in recent times, according to insurers. Insurance Ireland chief executive Moya Murdoch said the judgment \u201cwill bring much needed certainty to the market and claimants can take comfort that their claims will be dealt with fairly and more expediently through the IRB instead of going through a lengthy litigation process\u201d. Legal costs on litigated cases are a multiple of those resolved through the IRB. She added: \u201cWhile it is too early in the process to see the full impact of today\u2019s judgment, it is safe to say it should encourage new entrants into the market which would be very welcome especially in the employers and public liability market, for business and consumers alike.\u201d Declining electric car sales: \u2018depreciation is wild at the moment\u2019 The average motor premiums fell 22 per cent between their peak in late 2017 and the end of 2022, according to Central Bank data, helped by an industry-wide decline in claims costs after the guidelines were introduced. However, the latest Central Statistics Office data shows that motor rates have increased by 4.2 per cent in the 12 months through February. The increase has largely been down to a spike in motor damage costs, amid inflation for labour and car parts, according to insurance sources. [\u00a0 Clarification of legal status of personal injury guidelines turns spotlight on insurers \u00a0] Half of motor claims settled in 2022 were under the guidelines. However, only a quarter of employers\u2019 and public liability claims were resolved under the guidelines that year, according to a Central Bank report published last week. Average premiums earned for packaged business policies \u2013 covering employers\u2019 liability, public liability and commercial property \u2013 rose 8 per cent in 2022, following a level of stability over the two previous years and a 32 per cent jump between 2013 and 2019.

            "author": "Tue Mar",
            "date": "2021-03-09",
            "raw_text": "An Irish Times article a few months back ( Time to review your house insurance ) covered a lot of points and pitfalls in regard to house insurance. However, I'm somewhat in the dark in regard to assessing the adequacy of my own house insurance, particularly in a worst-case scenario of a total rebuild.  Our Dublin house is a mid-1960s-design semi-detached house with garage. It is generally reflective of the building standards of that era, with some modest heating and insulation improvements over the years.  Building regulations and standards have vastly improved in the interim and are about to go through yet another revision to accommodate the new environmental standards.  In the case of a total rebuild \u2013 and this is the level of insurance I feel should be provided for \u2013 how should I go about providing adequately for this at my next renewal?  Your question sheds light on a number of important issues. Firstly, reinstatement costs to rebuild your property must take account of current building regulations, which are constantly changing. In the unfortunate event that your property is destroyed, the new building must meet the standards that are in place at the time of rebuilding. Secondly, the amount your home is insured for should be calculated on a \u201ctotal loss\u201d scenario. This assumes that the house is destroyed, has to be demolished, the site cleared and then completely rebuilt. The amount should allow for complete replacement of the house, footpaths, parking areas and fencing and should include VAT. As well as the cost of rebuilding, the reinstatement value must also cover professional fees such as those of a chartered building surveyor, or architect\u2019s fees that detail the replacement property and apply for planning permission. Engineers\u2019 fees to design new structural elements should also be covered, as should fees for a chartered quantity surveyor to control the rebuilding costs. There will also be a requirement to appoint an assigned certifier under the building regulations and a project supervisor for the design process under health and safety legislation. You describe your property as a typical 1960s semi-detached house with garage in Dublin. Where properties are straight-forward and are built after 1960, I suggest that you use the   Society of Chartered Surveyors Guide to House Rebuilding Costs for Insurance Purposes . This guide is intended to assist you in insuring your home and briefly explains the more important aspects of house insurance. It also emphasises the importance of adequately insuring what is probably your most valuable asset. Calculating amount The SCSI website also has a \u201cready reckoner\u201d table to assist in calculating the correct amount for typical houses in various parts of the country. The figures shown in the table are a minimum base cost guide for your house insurance. The figures assume a standard quality specification with normal foundations, timber frames or brick/block walls, concrete tiled roof, concrete ground floor and timber first floor, softwood flush doors and double-glazed windows, painted plaster to walls, plastered ceilings, standard electrics and heating to include insulation, air-tight construction, heat recovery and heat pump to latest BER ratings. The sum insured should be increased if you have better-than-average kitchen fittings, built-in wardrobes, enhanced finishes and any other items not normally included in an estate-type house. For more historic houses or bespoke properties, the tables should not be used and instead a reinstatement valuation should be prepared by a chartered surveyor. Remember that home insurance policies differ, some covering more than others. It is therefore important to examine your policy very carefully to make sure you are insuring for the correct amount. To find a local chartered surveyor who can assist on this matter, use the \"find an expert\" search at  scsi.ie With building cost inflation running at an average of 6.5 per cent over the past 18 months, it is important to make sure that your reinstatement valuation is correct. Remember also that the market value of your property has no bearing on the level of house insurance required. We all take out insurance and hope that we never have to use it. If that awful day does come however, make sure that you are well prepared.  \u2013 Noel Larkin Noel Larkin is a chartered building surveyor and a member of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland,  scsi.ie",

            "raw_text": "Family First Life  specialises in mortgage life insurance, final expense life insurance, as well as retirement planning through universal life policies, and retirement protection through the use of fixed index annuities. Working with multiple carriers, Family First Life works to ensure better protection of their clients and their agents as well. They have recently hit a record week of over 10 million issues, and they are the number one\u00a0life distributor with Americo since 2014 and Mutual of Omaha for the past four years. An insurance premium is essentially the amount of money you pay for the insurance policy you have bought. This is done after a given period. Explaining this, Family First Life also notes the price per policy will tend to differ from person to person. Each situation is unique. Additionally, there are different types of policies. Here are five factors that will affect your life insurance policy premiums according to a leading insurance IMO, Family First Life: Type of insurance policy There are different types of life insurance - a whole life policy and term policy being the two main policies. With a whole life policy, better known as a permanent policy, this is where the life insurance policy lasts your entire life. On the other hand, a term policy is a temporary cover depending on the time agreed upon with the insurer. With the whole life policy,   Family First Life  explains that you must keep paying the premiums for it to last your entire life. Since it is a permanent package, it is a bit more expensive compared to the term policy. This equally means the benefits will also be much higher. Age Age is an essential factor in determining premiums; the older you are, the higher your premiums. While no one can predict when they will die, life expectancy is around 75\u201380 years. For those who are much older, premiums are higher to help them save up much more. Health condition In calculating premiums, Family First Life explains that knowing the health of the insured is essential. This helps the insurer know if there are any existing medical conditions. Depending on your health, the insurer calculates the risks involved to determine the amount you need to pay as coverage.

            "raw_text": "The main attraction of Catherine Chidgey\u2019s imaginative and well-executed novel The Axeman\u2019s Carnival is its winsome narrator, a young Australian magpie living on a sheep farm on the South Island of Aotearoa New Zealand. Named Tama (short for \u2018Tamagotchi\u2019, also M\u0101ori for \u2018son\u2019) by Marnie, the woman who takes him in as a nestling, he grows into a surrogate child, though Marnie\u2019s husband Rob disapproves. An astonishing mimic of human speech and lovable comic trickster, Tama becomes a Twitter sensation, and Marnie and Rob start monetising his fame to salvage their ailing farm. Despite this feelgood premise, Chidgey\u2019s fable has tragedy at its core. Disappointment, anxiety and trauma colour most relationships in the novel, human and non-human. Marnie is grieving a failed pregnancy and always fearful of upsetting her violent husband. Rob turns to drink to forget his financial woes and is constantly preoccupied with his desire to win the local annual axeman competition. Marnie\u2019s mother Barbara still hasn\u2019t processed her divorce and projects her frustration on her daughters, while Marnie\u2019s sister Ange no longer feels desired by her husband. Tama himself has father issues and is haunted by death. Animal narrators tend to be used to expose the strangeness of human behaviour, and Tama is a highly effective device in this regard. Neither fully human nor truly magpie, he\u2019s a perceptive observer of the complex lives around him but can\u2019t always make sense of people\u2019s actions and motivations. Often, he simply concludes that \u201cthat is how houses worked\u201d. Former US prosecutor on the justice system: \u2018When I see kids come into court in chains, I can\u2019t help thinking of slavery\u2019 Former US prosecutor on the justice system: \u2018When I see kids come into court in chains, I can\u2019t help thinking of slavery\u2019 [\u00a0 \u2018The first pang I got for the book was wondering if Jeeves ever feels class rage\u2019 \u00a0] Equally, the novel\u2019s humans often fail to understand its avian characters. It\u2019s intriguing how Chidgey plays around with misconceptions and superstitions about magpies \u2013 not least because, as the novel points out, these have simply been transposed from Eurasian on to Australian magpies, which aren\u2019t even corvids. A slightly discordant note is struck by a redundant interlude with vaudevillian eco-activists who bumble around and bicker like a pair of central casting Coen brothers baddies, and some of the foreshadowing feels heavy-handed. These are minor quibbles, however. Chidgey elegantly weaves together social commentary, magic realism, folklore and myth, and her treatment of serious themes is deft. The language is poetic without feeling overwrought. The Axeman\u2019s Carnival is a deeply engaging novel with an original and remarkably charming star.",

            "date": "2022-04-21",
            "raw_text": "Businesses and charities are facing growing bills for liability insurance cover despite recent reforms, according to a new survey from the Alliance for Insurance Reform. Released to mark the first anniversary of new judicial guidelines for personal injury awards \u2013 which aimed to sharply reduce many court awards \u2013 the survey of 954 respondents found that liability insurance premiums have actually increased by 16 per cent. The cost of premiums is threatening their future, 42 per cent of respondents said, while nine in 10 felt the Government was not doing enough to address the issue. Liability insurance is cover taken out by businesses, charities, community and voluntary groups, and sports and cultural organisations to meet the cost of any claims for injury or damage to other people\u2019s property on their premises or at events organised by them. PIAB awards General damages for minor injuries being awarded by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) have fallen by 47 per cent when loss of earnings and medical bills are excluded, Peter Boland, director of the insurance reform group said. The number of claims has also fallen every year since 2016. Mr Boland says the new judicial guidelines, combined with the closure of services during Covid-19 lockdowns resulting in no claims, should have seen liability insurance premiums fall. However, this has not happened, according to respondents to their survey. The guidelines are having an impact on motor premiums, which are down 9 per cent compared with May of last year, Mr Boland said. However, liability insurance premiums have increased by 16 per cent, according to his group\u2019s research. Almost three-quarters of businesses surveyed reported the addition of new excesses or exclusions on their policies since 2019. More than two-fifths said their businesses\u2019 ability to grow was being impacted, and one in three said they were prevented from providing certain services. Charities and voluntary organisations are now winding down what they offer or have halted plans to provide additional services, Mr Boland said. Insurance Ireland said they strongly supported the new judicial guidelines, but they were concerned by the significantly lower acceptance levels of the awards by claimants. \u201cThe worry with the lower acceptancy rate is that more cases will go to litigation,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cIt will be essential that the cases are heard expeditiously and that the courts confirm the guidelines in their procedures.\u201d Duty of care Eoin McCambridge, managing director of McCambridge\u2019s restaurant and deli in Galway city, said the Government must reform duty-of-care legislation. \u201cThe duty of care is effectively absolute. If someone walks into my shop and anything happens to them, it doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019ve done, I am responsible,\u201d he said. He says he was paying \u20ac120,000 in premiums for insurance at just one shop at one stage and, over the last decade, he estimates he has paid out almost \u20ac800,000 for cover. Now three years without a claim, his annual premium has fallen to \u20ac90,000, which he says is still not sustainable. \u201cThere is no thought of personal responsibility. We have people suing for falling down stairs, but they were on their mobile phones texting, yet the claim succeeds.\u201d He said businesses are happy to pay for genuine claims and to cover lost earnings and medical fees but argues that general damages of \u20ac20,000 or \u20ac30,000 for fully recoverable injuries, such as bruising or strained limbs, are \u201cjust not affordable\u201d. Tracy Sheridan, owner of Kidspace play centres in Rathfarnham and Rathcoole in Dublin, said many small businesses have had to take out loans to pay their premiums. \u201cOur insurance is going up despite being closed for the past year and despite having no claims.\u201d Mr Boland said that, alongside duty of care and PIAB reform, the Government needed to ensure there was more competition in the liability insurance market. Insurance Ireland added they recognised the importance of rebalancing the duty of care and strengthening protections in the Occupiers\u2019 Liability Act. \u201cA more stable sector, delivered through Government reform, will reduce market volatility and bring more certainty for customers, businesses and insurers alike and support increased competitiveness of the market.\u201d The Department of Justice was contacted for comment.",

            "title": "The trouble with health insurance in Ireland, and what could be done about it",
            "author": "Dominic Coyle",
            "date": "2024-02-02",
            "raw_text": "Private health insurance is in the news again for all the wrong reasons \u2013 another hike in premiums. VHI, the largest player in the market has  announced an average rise of 7 per cent across its plans from March . On top of a similar 7 per cent increase last October and an average price rise of 4.8 per cent last March, it means customers will be paying 20 per cent more for their health cover from March than they were this time last year. And those are just the average increases. Customers on some plans will be facing a rise of closer to 10 per cent this time around, depending on their policy. Obviously the hit to your pocket will depend on which plan you have but, with the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) saying the average premium across the market is running at around \u20ac1,500 a year, people face an average increase this time around of \u20ac105 per person. Over the past year, the premium hikes for that average policy come to \u20ac300 per person \u2013 or \u20ac1,200 for a family of four. If you were facing that level of increase across any other household outgoing, there would be uproar and a stampede out the door. The trouble with private health insurance in Ireland is threefold. First, there are only three players in the market \u2013 VHI, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health \u2013 and they are all raising premiums by more or less the same amount. Second, the dysfunctional Irish healthcare system means people know they face extraordinarily long waiting periods in the public health system. That inevitably increases the pressure on consumers to consider private health insurance \u2013 a safety valve successive governments have been only too happy to accommodate over many years, rather than addressing the fundamental issues with healthcare provision in Ireland. On top of this, since 2015, a lifetime community rating has been introduced to protect a system that charges everyone on a policy the same regardless of age or medical record. The lifetime community rating determines that you will pay 2 per cent more than the sticker price for your private health policy for every year over the age of 34 that you are when you first take out private cover. And you will do this for life. This essentially penalises anyone who decides they do not need to consider private health insurance until they are older \u2013 either because they are less likely to suffer serious health issues or because their financial priorities at that age are affording a home or raising a young family. So if you are 35 when you first take out private health cover, the 2 per cent premium means the HIA\u2019s \u201caverage premium\u201d of \u20ac1,500 will cost you \u20ac1,530. Not too onerous you might think, but if you hold off until the age of 45 when mortgage and family spending might be back under more control, you will be paying \u20ac330 more for your cover, or \u20ac1,830 for a policy that your 45 year old neighbour is still paying \u20ac1,500 for because they signed up with a private health insurer at 34. And naturally, the older you get, and especially in retirement, the more these \u201cpenalty premiums\u201d are likely to force you to downgrade your cover at precisely the time you will most likely need it. The bottom line is that if prices continue to rise, as they have done recently, we will move as a market from securing the medical cover we want to the cover we can afford, but which may well leave us exposed to massive bills if we are unlucky enough to experience a serious illness. Finally, the sheer tsunami of policies available can be overwhelming. VHI alone has around 150 different policies. Between them, the three insurers have northwards of 320 schemes on offer. How is anyone supposed to keep track of so many, never mind compare the cover provided across such a range? This problem was thrown into stark relief last week by one reader. They had gone to Mater Private last month for a CT Scan only to be told they needed to pay \u20ac525 up front. Having previously used Mater\u2019s Northern Cross facility for other scans that were billed directly to the VHI, they had assumed they were covered. Apparently not, and to add insult to injury, they will get back only \u20ac120 of that \u20ac525 under their policy. \u201cWhat\u2019s annoying me is the fact that you don\u2019t know about this until you\u2019re faced with either paying or going back to the consultant to ask for a different referral letter which slows the whole process up even more,\u201d our reader said. We asked the VHI what had happened here, and it shows up the sheer complexity of the system. It turns out that although Mater\u2019s Northern Cross did offer \u201cdirect pay\u201d \u2013 ie they billed the VHI not the VHI member \u2013 for CT scans, the same did not apply in the Mater Private, even though it is part of the same group. And that direct pay facility at Northern Cross ended on January 1st this year as the Mater group decided to move to a \u201ccustomer pays and claims back from the insurer\u201d model. And no, you\u2019re right, VHI didn\u2019t proactively tell their customers that, which is less than helpful even if this reader would never have been covered from the CT scan at Mater Private. Well, when I say never, that\u2019s not quite true. You see the Mater apparently does still direct bill for CT scans for cancer patients. Confused? I thought you might be. The people at VHI note that they currently pay out more than \u20ac30 million annually for outpatient scans, and says it has \u201cgreatly expanded the number of centres now approved for full cover direct pay MRI scans\u201d. But not, it appears, at the Mater, at least if the referral for your MRI comes from your GP. That was covered at the Mater up to the end of last year but no longer. Again, I missed the notification. I\u2019ve no doubt the same happens with the other two insurers but the point remains that customers paying for expensive private cover should at least expect to be told when there are changes in service offered. It would not have helped this reader as they presented at Mater Private, which has not covered their scan under direct pay anyway, but had they turned up at Mater Northern Cross where non-oncology CT scans had been covered up to the end of last year, they would have had very good reason to be furious. At least they were in the fortunate position to pay \u20ac525 up front: not everyone could. It appears any VHI customer other than cancer patients looking for an outpatient CT scan in Dublin will have to head for either Affidea in Dundrum or Alliance Medical in Smithfield. With the reduced access, no doubt queues will be longer. The advice from the VHI, who, to be fair, did get in direct touch with our reader, is as follows: 1. Read your policy documents when they send your renewal as things change in terms of cover. 2. If you are referred for a procedure, contact the VHI to check if you\u2019re still covered. Your consultant or GP will not necessarily know that direct payment arrangements have changed. So, they may refer you to a facility that may or may not be covered. 3. Scans have codes and if you have the code this reduces the margin for error as scan prices differ. However, getting the code is not as straightforward as it might be. Your referring medic won\u2019t necessarily have it, in which case you need to contact the radiology department in the hospital/scan facility you have been referred to and ask them for it. 4. How much you are reimbursed on direct payment depends on your cover plan so check back on your documents. All in all, in my view, that puts an awful lot of the legwork on potentially ill patients and adds to pressure on doctors, hospitals and scan centres as they have to spend significant time fielding calls from bewildered private health insurance customers. It does not seem unreasonable that the least you can expect for your \u20ac1,500 policy is that the insurer\u2019s website presents this information in an easy to understand format, accessible from the top level of their site \u2013 ie the home page. VHI has a downloadable directory of what is covered where, but I defy you to find it on a casual visit to their website. The same is true for Irish Life Health. Only Laya seems to make any real effort to make the information readily available to customers or those considering taking out a policy. The issue here is that private health insurance customers are paying for reassurance \u2013 the comfort of knowing that if something happens, they can get it sorted quickly. If you\u2019re looking for treatment, you are already unwell or fearing you might be. You shouldn\u2019t have to have to go through the added stress of having to \u201cshop around\u201d as our reader was advised, in hindsight.

            "author": "Mary Carolan",
            "date": "2021-03-22",
            "raw_text": "The Supreme Court has ruled insolvent insurer Quinn Insurance must provide security for the multimillion euro legal costs of accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) of defending a pending action over its auditing of Quinn Insurance (QIL). PWC and QIL previously agreed the legal costs of the case, initiated in 2012 with a hearing date yet to be fixed, would be \u20ac30million. The High Court will decide, at a later date, exactly how much security, expected to be provided from the State's Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), must be provided. QIL, placed in administration in 2010, had an underwriting business of \u20ac1 billion and its losses were met by a 2 per cent levy on all non-life insurance policies in the State. Claims QIL\u2019s primary business now is the prosecution of its claims against PwC over its alleged negligent auditing of the insurance underwriter between 2005 and 2008. PwC denies the claims. After PwC won an appeal to the Court of Appeal over the High Court\u2019s refusal to order QIL to provide security for costs, QIL sought a further appeal. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal to address legal issues concerning the appropriate test for security for costs and, in judgments on Monday, unanimously dismissed the appeal. The main judgment of the five-judge court was delivered by the Chief Justice, Mr Justice Frank Clarke. Mr Justice Donal O\u2019Donnell and Mr Justice John MacMenamin delivered concurring judgments setting out their observations on the issues. The Chief Justice said security for costs should be ordered if there is a prima facie basis for suggesting the impecuniosity of the relevant plaintiff is due to the alleged wrongdoing. Even if that test is not met, the court may consider whether it is likely the proceedings will be stifled and take the result of that consideration into account in assessing whether ordering or refusing security runs the least risk of injustice. QIL has made out no special circumstances, either on the basis of \u201cimpecuniosity due to alleged wrongdoing\u201d, or the public interest in ensuring the case proceeds, for a refusal to order security, he held. Liabilities He noted the final sum owed by QIL to the ICF is some \u20ac1.1 billion, exceeding its estimated total losses of some \u20ac900 million. PwC had argued, even if QIL\u2019s claim was wholly successful, its liabilities would still exceed its assets by some \u20ac200 million, meaning it would be unable to pay PWC\u2019s legal costs. On that basis, it was argued PwC could not be regarded as the sole cause of QIL\u2019s insolvency as PwC could not be held responsible for the gap of \u20ac200 million. The Chief Justice said explanations given as to how QIL could have remained as a solvent trading entity if the wrongdoing alleged against PwC had not occurred \u201care very much at the speculative end of the spectrum\u201d. He was not satisfied sufficient evidence was given to explain how there are unusual circumstances to justify QIL\u2019s claim it would have been able to pay costs were it not for the alleged wrongdoing. When coupled with the fact it would seem unlikely the QIL claim would be awarded in full, he concluded QIL had failed to establish the \u201cimpecuniosity due to alleged wrongdoing\u201d special circumstance to defeat an order for security. Nor had QIL established any likelihood the proceedings will be stifled if security was ordered, he held. At least to date, the ICF has been prepared to provide funding to allow QIL to pay its own costs in progressing these proceedings to this stage, he noted. While QIL does not have \u201ca blank cheque\u201d, the High Court can order further payments from the ICF towards QIL\u2019s legal costs if that was considered appropriate. In this complex case, security might be ordered on a staged basis by reference to important milestones in the case, such as completion and delivery of discovery, he added. Order upheld In rejecting a separate appeal raising similar legal issues, the Supreme Court upheld an order requiring two companies involved in bottling and distributing international spirits brands to provide \u20ac1 million security for costs in their action alleging Irish Distillers Ltd (IDL) is abusing a dominant position in the Irish whiskey market. Protege International Group (Cyprus) Ltd and Avalon International Management Inc, incorporated in Panama, have sued IDL, a subsidiary of Pernod Richard SA, alleging it has refused over several years since 2002 to supply them with Irish whiskey. IDL opposes the action and previously secured a High Court order for security for costs. On Monday, the Supreme Court dismissed the companies\u2019 appeal over a Court of Appeal decision affirming the High Court order. The Chief Justice said the companies had not established, on a prime facie basis, their current impecuniosity was due to the wrongdoing alleged against IDL in the case and nor had they shown a likelihood the proceedings would be stifled if security was ordered. * This article was amended on March 23rd,2021",

            "raw_text": "The Government programme on insurance reform is starting to deliver results, but it will take time to judge the full impact of what has been done so far and there are a number of key measures still to be pushed through. Motor insurance premiums are continuing to fall and are down by more than one quarter from their 2017 highs, according to the latest implementation report on the Government\u2019s insurance programme. In other areas of the insurance market progress is slower, but measures in the pipeline should, in time, have an impact. The programme to address high insurance costs is under way now over two governments and the latest action plan was launched in December 2020. It was clear by 2017 that action was needed and initially motor insurance was targeted, with a wider reform programme taken on by this Government. It is an example of the kind of action needed across a range of departments and agencies which requires significant central coordination. It shows that results can be achieved, though it is a lengthy and difficult process. The fall in motor insurance premiums follows a period of sharp increases, which in turn resulted from a period of unsustainable competition and mispriced risk which led a number of insurers to go bust or leave the Irish market. Data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board show a significant 44 per cent fall in award values for general damages, following new judicial guidelines. This has led to premiums falling and also , as figures out yesterday showed, rising profits for insurers. There may be timing issues here \u2013 and insurers do need to make a profit \u2013 but premiums to motorists should continue to fall. One complicating factor is that general insurers have in many cases been using profits from motor insurance to cross-subsidise other areas, including liability insurance. Presumably lower claims costs will also feed through here. Also, a legislative change is planned here to ensure that those who suffer injury take some responsibility for their own actions. Measures to combat fraudulent claims, including new cooperation between the Garda and the industry, have also had some results and are due to be progressed further. These are important steps to combat the claims culture \u2013 the unquestioning attitude that no matter how an accident happens, the insurer will pay a significant sum.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 As the latest implementation report shows, the Irish market needs to involve less litigation and more use of mediation \u2013 legislation before the Oireachtas is designed to increase the role of PIAB in this area. The Bill also proposes to change the board\u2019s name to the Personal Injuries Resolution Board, to better reflect its role. The industry must also play its part. And more competition in the sector, another of the plan\u2019s goals, would give it welcome encouragement to do so.",

            "raw_text": "Easytrip Ireland, a motorway tolling and parking tag provider, is planning to enter the Irish motor insurance market next year as a broker offering coverage from a number of insurers. The company, which is a joint venture between the French multinational Egis and the Dublin-based Electro Automation, will initially target its exiting 200,000-plus customer base as it seeks to build an insurance business, according to Colin Delaney, chief executive of Easytrip Ireland. \u201cMotor insurance prices remain too high in Ireland,\u201d Mr Delaney said, adding that the data Easytrip Ireland holds on customers should help insurance underwriters to divide them into different categories and offer better rates. Mr Delaney declined to name the insurance companies it is in talks with or to outline how much of the motor insurance market his business, which also offers roadside breakdown assistance, is targeting. The average Irish motor premium rose 66 per cent from a low point of \u20ac431 in the final three months of 2013 to \u20ac714 in the second quarter of 2018 before dropping 9 per cent to \u20ac653 in late 2019, according to a Central Bank report published last month. The report also found that insurers operating in the Republic saw profits on motor coverage lines surge 9 per cent to \u20ac142 million last year, as the loss ratio hovered around the lowest levels of the past decade. Cost of claims Claim costs fell to 59 per cent of total motor premiums in 2019 from a peak of 92 per cent in 2014 and an average of 72 per cent over the past decade, according to the bank\u2019s second annual Private Motor Insurance Report, drawing on the National Claims Information Database figure. Meanwhile, the Government published a 66-point action plan this week in an effort to tackle insurance costs in the State. These include enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to limit personal injury claims ending up going the legal route, as well as a plan to place perjury on a statutory footing, making it easier to prosecute cases of alleged insurance fraud. The recently established Judicial Council is working on guidelines for personal injury court awards, and the Government has decided to \"monitor\" whether they will ultimately need to be capped.",

            "raw_text": "T he road to lowering insurance costs in Ireland is a long and winding one. The latest episode is an agreement signed by four insurers and broker AA Ireland, following an investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). This found evidence of so-called price signalling by companies in relation to motor premium increases \u2013 in other words potential collusion in letting competitors know when prices were going to rise. In turn this blunts competition as companies can increase prices without fear that they will be out of line and lose business. This is no technical misdemeanour. In markets where there are a small number of big companies there is always the possibility of this kind of activity, as it can help support profits. Consumers need companies competing with each other for business, not a cosy cartel agreeing when prices will go up. The companies \u2013 while claiming they did not engage in anti-competitive behaviour \u2013 have agreed to strengthen their internal compliance procedures. It goes without saying that this needs close monitoring. It also also concerning that Brokers Ireland, the body which represents many in the broking sector, has not signed up. Many consumers rely on brokers to find them the best deal. Consumer regulation has often fallen between stools in Ireland over the years, including in the financial sector where the Central Bank has an important role but so \u2013 in some cases \u2013 does the CCPC. After a number of companies went bust in the insurance sector around and just after the financial crash, the Central Bank\u2019s focus was on boosting solvency and reserve levels. Consumer interests appear to have taken second place. It is welcome that the CCPC is pushing ahead with its investigations into the insurance sector and will have more powers in the years ahead. It is part of a wider story of trying to cut insurance costs, including reforming personal injury awards and seeking to reduce legal costs. It remains to be seen if, and by how much, this might be reflected in lower premiums. And following the CCPC investigation, insurance companies need to have a long and hard look at themselves. Their advertising talks of putting customers first. Their practices reflect other priorities.",

            "raw_text": "UK insurance giant Aviva\u2019s combined operating profit from its Irish general insurance and life and pensions businesses doubled last year to \u20ac57 million. The general insurance unit, Aviva Insurance Ireland, including car and home coverage and led by chief executive Declan O'Rourke, saw its operating profit increase by 34.4 per cent to \u20ac43 million, amid lower expenses and reduced claims due to Covid-19. Gross written premiums in the business rose 1.7 per cent to \u20ac474 million, mainly as a result of growth in commercial business lines, the company said in a statement on Wednesday as the wider Aviva group reported annual results. \u201cIn 2020, we entered the financial lines market, expanding our range of covers to include professional indemnity and directors and officers insurance. We have also deployed significant new capacity in areas where insurance capacity is scarce, for example, the charity, leisure and community sectors,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Rourke. Mr O'Rourke echoed comments from rivals in recent months in saying that while Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Piab) awards have fallen as a result of new judicial guidelines introduced last April, there has also been a decline in acceptance rates for Piab assessments and a reduction in direct settlements. \u201cThis will ultimately lead to more claims going to court, which is the most expensive claims settlement channel. This will undermine the impact of reforms,\u201d he said. Piab powers Still, Mr O\u2019Rourke said he welcomed the Government\u2019s current plan to strengthen the powers of the Piab to compel early engagement between parties involved in claims and reduce the level of cases going to court. Meanwhile, Aviva Life and Pensions Ireland, led by chief executive David Elliot, swung into an operating profit of \u20ac14 million last year from a \u20ac4 million loss sustained in 2020, according to a separate statement from that company. The improvement was driven by reduced expenses, higher recurring income and \u201cimproving claims experience\u201d, it said. The present value of new business premiums grew by 10 per cent last year to \u20ac1.91 billion, due to strong sales in protection and unit-linked investments. Russian exposure Overall, Aviva reported a 10 per cent drop in 2021 operating profit and said it will return \u00a34.75 billion (\u20ac5.71 billion) to shareholders. Aviva had previously said it would give back at least \u00a34 billion to investors following a string of disposals. Activist investor Cevian has sought \u00a35 billion in a cash return by the end of 2022. Aviva has raised \u00a37.5 billion from selling eight businesses across the globe since the appointment of Amanda Blanc as chief executive in July 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve achieved a lot in the last year but we\u2019re only just getting started,\u201d said Ms Blanc. Aviva\u2019s fund management unit has less than 0.1 per cent exposure to Russia and the British insurer is planning to sell it, said Ms Blanc on Wednesday. \u201cWe have a very, very minimal exposure to Russia via Aviva Investors . . . We will be divesting of that exposure as soon as we practically can,\u201d she said. Aviva also said it was buying adviser Succession Wealth for \u00a3385 million. It upgraded its cost savings target to \u00a3750 million for the 2018-24 period. Cevian had been pushing Aviva to cut costs more aggressively. Operating profit from continuing operations was \u00a31.63 billion, hurt by weaker performance in the insurer\u2019s UK life business. Aviva said it would pay a total 2021 dividend of 22.05 pence per share, and expected a 40 per cent increase in 2022 dividend to around 31.5 pence. \u2013 Additional reporting: Reuters",

            "author": "Fiona Reddan",
            "date": "2020-12-08",
            "raw_text": "With health insurance renewals season coming up and the cost of cover inching up once more, you might be weighing your options. Do you simply stomach the increases, shop around more carefully, or cancel, or downgrade your cover? According to the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), more than a million consumers are due to renew their health insurance in the coming months with about 50 per cent of policies up for renewal. Dermot Goode, health insurance adviser with Total Health Cover, says the cost of insurance is \"definitely on an upward spiral\" and customers should expect increases of between 5 and 8 per cent in their renewals this year. While the emphasis should be on shopping around to get the keenest prices, this can be confusing in a market overwhelmed with choice. According to the HIA, there are currently 314 products on the market. Faced with such a plethora of options, some parents may wonder whether an easy route to cutting their annual premium is to simply stop cover for their children. After all, as there are no private hospitals for children, some might argue, why bother getting them covered? As with health insurance in general, insuring your children comes down to your personal choice \u2013 and how much pressure your bank balance can withstand. But here are some reasons why you might find it worthwhile. Private care According to John Haigney, health insurance adviser with Lyons Financial Services, the main reason for getting private health cover for your children is the access it gives to procedures in private hospitals. While young children will typically be treated in public hospitals, Goode notes that when children are closer to the age of 10 or their early teens, \u201cyou\u2019ll find consultants are happy to bring them into private hospitals for day-care procedures\u201d. So ensuring you have cover for this may be a priority. There may be no private children\u2019s hospitals in Ireland but many of the adult hospitals now offer services to children and it is for this reason that many parents seek out cover for their offspring. Beacon Hospital in Dublin, for example, launched a paediatric service in 2017 and offers day-care and overnight procedures, which include general surgery, urology, dentistry and ophthalmology. The Mater Private in Dublin also has a team of paediatric consultants, surgeons and anaesthetists. According to Haigney, these hospitals can offer fast access to procedures, such as grommets and tonsillectomies or sports-related injuries; something that children may otherwise have to wait months for as public patients. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage to have access to as it allows you to skip the waiting list in the public system,\u201d he says. Public care Private health insurance will also offer cover in the event a child has to spend time in a public hospital, where you could be charged \u20ac80 a night up to a maximum charge of \u20ac800. \u201cThere\u2019s no [other] way around it unless you have a medical card,\u201d says Goode. And, like adults, it also allows children to skip waiting lists in public hospitals. \u201cHealth insurance for children is not about a private room really, it\u2019s about access,\u201d says Goode. And, if you don\u2019t get cover for your children now, they\u2019ll be subject to the five-year waiting period to be treated for existing conditions should you put them on insurance at a later stage. Day-to-day benefits With free GP care up to the age of six (and plans to extend it to the age of 12), depending on your circumstances you might find that money back on everyday health visits won\u2019t be a priority for your children. The cheapest children's policies, for example, typically don't offer cover for day-to-day benefits, while you'll be looking at an excess of about \u20ac120 on policies costing in the \u20ac200-\u20ac250 range. But if you pay more, you will get better cover. Irish Life Health's Be Fit policy, for example, costing \u20ac308 per child, has an excess of just \u20ac1 and offers one free GP visit and 50 per cent back on subsequent ones. According to Haigney, if you want to upgrade a policy at a later date to get access to these benefits for your children, you won\u2019t be subject to any waiting periods. \u201cYou can upgrade as you need,\u201d he says. Shopping around If you have decided that private cover for your children is worthwhile, you should be prepared to shop around to ensure you get the best deal. According to Haigney, unless there is a pre-existing condition for children or you need specific cover for a reason, usually you'll be looking at a fairly basic policy that offers cover for private hospitals. The cheapest policies for children start at about \u20ac130 a year, such as Vhi's PublicPlus Care (\u20ac134.11) or Assure Protect from Laya Healthcare (\u20ac151.28). However, neither covers private hospitals. According to Goode, if you pay between \u20ac200 and \u20ac250, you\u2019ll get cover for both public and private hospitals. Irish Life Health\u2019s Benefit Plan is one such option as it gives you private treatment in public as well as private hospitals. It costs \u20ac206 for a child under 18 and covers day-care procedures in private hospitals, although there is a \u20ac150 excess on it. And remember, just because you are on a certain policy doesn\u2019t mean that your children must be on the same one. \u201cEvery family should be looking at splitting their cover, everyone should be on a plan to suit their needs.\u201d Let\u2019s say you pick a premium policy, such as Irish Life Health\u2019s Health Plan 06, which costs \u20ac2,314 a year. If you were to automatically enrol your children on to that plan, it would cost \u20ac792 each for the first three children and \u20ac120 thereafter. But the costs could more than halve if you put the children on to the insurer\u2019s 4D Health 1 Plan, which costs \u20ac306 per child, or the aforementioned Benefit Plan, at \u20ac206. You should also watch out for special offers; at Laya Healthcare, for example, from January 1st, while you have to pay for cover for your first child, the rest are free. And you don't always have to insure your children with your insurer; both Irish Life Health and Vhi, for example, say that a policy for a child can be set up in a parent's or guardian's name when insuring a child under 18. Child-Friendly Insurance Cover Vaccinations With vaccinations on our minds at present, it\u2019s also worth noting that private health insurance can help defray the costs of additional vaccines you might wish your children to have. The chickenpox vaccine costs about \u20ac160-\u20ac180, while you can also pay for a vaccine to protect against meningitis B. While this vaccine is now given as standard to newborn babies, it was introduced only in 2016, which means that many parents may wish to pay for older children who may not have received it. It\u2019s more expensive than the chickenpox job, at about \u20ac150-\u20ac160 a shot and two are needed, so that\u2019s about \u20ac300-\u20ac320 in total. Prices vary from one GP practice to another so it might be worthwhile shopping around. When it comes to getting some money back, Irish Life will pay between \u20ac30 and \u20ac50 towards the cost of both vaccines on some of its plans. Vhi offers a \u20ac50 or \u20ac60 benefit for the vaccinations and this is included on a range of family plans and also in its new FirstCare Extra Day-to-Day plan, which costs from \u20ac198 per child. Laya Healthcare offers cover of up to \u20ac50 towards the vaccinations (including HPV vaccine) on its new plan, Everyday Health. It says the benefit will also be added to two more plans from the 1st of January: Signify and Signify Plus. Dental care It\u2019s one of the biggest expenses facing parents but unfortunately cover for orthodontics remains limited on most insurance policies. Laya Healthcare, for example, says it doesn\u2019t offer any cover for braces, although it does offer a contribution towards routine and emergency dental. The most comprehensive dental benefit it offers is a 50 per cent refund on the everyday medical expenses, up to \u20ac500 per year, and that benefit is available on more than 50 per cent of its plans. Vhi has two dental plans but the benefit available towards orthodontic costs is a lifetime maximum of \u20ac500 per child on Dental Plan and \u20ac1,000 on Dental Plan Plus. And this benefit is subject to a 24-month waiting period. As an extra, members can get \u20ac500 off the cost of orthodontic treatment via clearbraces.ie and there is no waiting period associated with this offer. Irish Life Health says members can claim a \u20ac100 cash benefit for the costs of an orthodontist on some of its plans. Speech therapy With significant waiting lists for the public speech-therapy service, some parents may opt to go privately. With Laya Healthcare, while the level of cover varies, some plans offer cover of up to 75 per cent of costs for up to 12 visits a year. At Vhi, the majority of its plans offer some benefit. This ranges from \u20ac20 for three visits to 75 per cent for unlimited visits subject to the annual excess and maximum of the plan. It also has a remote speech and language therapy service that is fully covered for all members. Irish Life Health also provides cover and says the amount of the contribution depends on the level of cover specified on a member\u2019s plan.",

            "raw_text": "Approval of a structure to pay a legal bill of some \u20ac29 million is still required before a case by the administrators of insolvent insurer Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL) against the firm's former auditors can go ahead, the High Court heard. The joint administrators of Quinn Insurance are suing PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for approximately \u20ac800 million claiming negligent auditing of the insurance underwriter between 2005 and 2008. PwC denies the claims. The case was initiated in 2012 and a central feature of the pre-trial process was whether the joint administrators of Quinn Insurance, Michael McAteer and Paul McCann, who were appointed by the Financial Regulator in April 2010, should be required to provide security of costs should QIL lose the case. This was in circumstances where it is an insolvent company whose main purpose was now to pursue this action given most of the Quinn insurance business had been transferred. The matter was finally determined last June when the Supreme Court ruled Quinn Insurance Ltd had to pay \u20ac5 million \"interim security\" towards the PwC legal costs as the price of the court not placing a stay on QIL's action. The issue of what the full cost of security should be had then to be determined by the High Court. The matter came before Mr Justice Denis McDonald on Tuesday when he was told the parties had agreed the total sum for security should be just over \u20ac29 million. The \u20ac5 million interim security, along with another \u20ac500,000 paid to allow an appeal go ahead, had already been provided leaving \u20ac23,520,834 to be provided. The court heard Quinn Insurance had proposed that it would make an application next month to the president of the High Court to approve the drawing down from the Insurance Compensation Fund, which is how payouts have been dealt with in the past, should QIL lose the case. Declan McGrath SC, for QIL, said the \u20ac5 million interim security had already been approved and the remaining \u20ac23.5 million would be ring-fenced once approval came from the High Court president. That approval will only come if the president is satisfied the industry compensation fund has or will have sufficient funds for any such drawdown, he said. He said it was recognised in the rules of the superior courts that there is a distinction between the State providing a comfort or guarantee (in relation to such payments) in respect of other persons. Paul Sreenan SC, for PwC, said this was not acceptable to his side. The normal way of providing security was the lodging of cash or an equivalent bond to the court that would be directly accessible. His clients were 100 different individuals who would be exposed in relation to this matter, even if successful in its defence. Quinn Insurance Ltd was saying it was entitled to some special position, which had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, he said. There was also a lack of clarity about whether it was even intended that the Insurance Compensation Fund would finance legal actions as distinct from providing payouts for the insurance business, he said. It was also possible there could be difficulties with a political willingness to pay this money in the future and in circumstances where there was almost certain to be a change in government when that time arrived, he said. Mr Justice McDonald expressed concern about an apparent level of uncertainty of how the money would be ring-fenced and that he had not been told what matters will be put before the High Court president. The judge agreed to a suggestion from Mr McGrath that the matter should be adjourned until after the application is made to the president of the High Court. It was absolutely crucial, as the Supreme Court had said, that this matter be brought on for hearing, the judge said. He complimented the parties on the agreement reached so far in relation to the security amount and urged them to continue such constructive engagement.",

            "raw_text": "The High Court has directed the Garda Sioch\u00e1na Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) to disclose the insurance details of a vehicle that drove the wrong way down Dublin\u2019s N7 and crashed head-on with an articulated lorry two years ago. The vehicle\u2019s occupants \u2013 Dean Maguire (29), Karl Freeman (26) and Graham Taylor (31) \u2013 died when it burst into flames following the collision on July 7th, 2021. The three deceased men, with addresses in Tallaght, Dublin, had a litany of previous convictions. The BMW 3 Series had its lights off and was on the wrong side of the road, apparently in an attempt to evade pursuing garda\u00ed. The driver of the oncoming truck, who was taken to hospital with serious injuries after the collision, this week secured High Court orders directing Gsoc to provide him with the names and addresses of the owner and driver of the car.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Gsoc must also disclose, by the end of this month, the vehicle\u2019s insurance details and its make, model and registration number, Mr Justice Brian O\u2019Moore ordered. As the application came while only the plaintiff was represented in court, the judge gave Gsoc permission to apply for a change to the orders. The court heard the plaintiff wants the information to assist with his application to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The truck driver\u2019s counsel, David Kent, said it might transpire that the deceased driver, once he is identified, might not have an estate. A Garda member has been served with summonses by Gsoc relating to two charges he faces over the alleged manner of his driving before the fatal crash. In a statement last week, Gsoc said \u201cthe Director of Public Prosecutions has instituted criminal proceedings against a member of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in relation to the incident\u201d.",

            "raw_text": "The number of homeless people in emergency accommodation has climbed to a new high, now standing at 13,866 including over 4,000 children. The latest data, published on Friday by the Department of Housing, shows there were 9,719 adults and 4,147 children in homeless accommodation last month. The figures represent an increase of 25 people since February when 13,841 were homeless, but an increase of 548 since December 2023 when the total was 13,318. This time last year, there were 11,988 people, including 3,472 children, listed as homeless. The latest figure represents an increase of 1,878 homeless people in a single year.

Tributes for cyclist killed in D\u00fan Laoghaire crash In Dublin, a total of 10,180 people, including 3,181 children, were counted as homeless last month \u2013 up from 8,775 people including 2,638 homeless children in March 2023. These figures do not include people sleeping rough or homeless asylum seekers. The figures for last month show that Irish-born account for just over half (55 per cent) of all the homeless with the rest coming from either EU or the UK (23 per cent) or further afield (22 per cent). Some 204 people living in emergency accommodation last month were over 65 years of age, while 53 per cent (5,146) were aged between 25 and 44. A further 2,709 were aged between 45 and 64 while 1,660 were aged between 18 and 24. Some 62 per cent of homeless adults were male, and 38 per cent female The number of homeless single adults now stands at 6,409, of whom 4,487 are in Dublin. Noting that homeless figures in Dublin have reached a new record high, increasing by 80 since February, homeless charity Dublin Simon said 111 offers of emergency accommodation are made nightly in the capital while just four households a day in the region are exiting homelessness. Chief executive Catherine Kenny said stories of \u201cheartbreak and struggle\u201d lie behind the \u201calarming statistics\u201d. \u201cThe escalating trend of adults and children seeking emergency accommodation each day and night is untenable. Prolonged stays in emergency shelters strip away hope, leaving deep scars on mental and physical health. \u201cThe impact on children is immeasurable, robbing them of their security and stability in some of their most important developmental years,\u201d she said. Ms Kenny said the figures are not only a result of a failing system but also due to a \u201cfailure of compassion.\u201d \u201cEach person experiencing homelessness in Dublin represents a painful testament to the failures of our society to provide for its most vulnerable members. They deserve more than temporary solutions and empty promises. They deserve homes,\u201d she said. Ms Kenny said \u201creal commitment\u201d is needed from Taoiseach Simon Harris to ensure that homelessness is flattened or reduced over the next 12 months. \u201cWe implore Cabinet to prioritise tackling the homelessness crisis and commit to implementing comprehensive strategies and effective policies to ensure that every individual and family has access to safe and stable housing,\u201d she said.

            "raw_text": "Insurance reformers welcomed confirmation on Monday that the Government plans to set up a specialist Garda unit to tackle bogus claims. The Government is due to announce that it is establishing an insurance fraud co-ordination office under the control of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau. Policyholders who suspect they are the victims of fraudulent claims will be able to report their suspicions direct to the new office without going through their insurers. Eoin McCambridge, managing director of McCambridge\u2019s restaurant and food store, a director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, said the organisation had been seeking the specialised Garda unit for some time. \u201cIt marks a major step in the battle against insurance fraud, formalising as it does a structured and streamlined approach by the garda\u00ed,\u201d he added. Mr McCambridge predicted the move would help deter anyone considering making a fictitious or exaggerated insurance claim. Office Peter Boland, Alliance director, said establishing the office would be the first move in eradicating insurance fraud, but cautioned that two more steps were needed. He called on insurers to hire suitably trained staff and develop technology to boost their anti-fraud units, as the Personal Injuries Commission recommended. \u201cThe days of settling fraudulent claims as an expedient and then passing the cost of this approach on to society must end,\u201d warned Mr Boland. \u201cSecondly, we call on the Garda Commissioner to urgently establish divisional structures to counter fraud,\u201d he said. \"This initiative was announced by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in 2019 but nothing has happened on it since.\"",

Bell, a student at Methodist College Belfast, won the competition for her portrait in coloured pencils, entitled Anticipation. Chairman of the judging panel, Gary Granville, who is professor of education at the National College of Art and Design (NCAD), described Bell\u2019s artwork as \u201can exceptionally well executed portrait, that tells of an \u2018aged serenity\u2019, of a full life with a wealth of experience and wisdom\u201d. No stranger to the competition, Bell was also the overall competition winner last year as well as winning Special Merit Awards in both 2020 and 2021. The inspiration for her prize-winning portrait came when she discovered a photo of an old woman and felt the emotion in her face would be fascinating to bring to life. \u201cI like working with portraits and when I saw this photo the detailed expression on the woman\u2019s face jumped out at me immediately. I knew it would be a challenging and interesting artwork to take on,\u201d she explained. Other top winners in the 16-18 age category included Donegal student, Weronika Jarowinska (16), a pupil at Loreto Secondary School Letterkenny who won second prize (\u20ac1,000) for her work called Man to Machine. Third prize (\u20ac750) went to Clare student, Eimear Fitzgerald (16), a pupil at Ennis Art School, for her work entitled Best Friends. In the 14-15 age category, first prize (\u20ac450) was won by Galway student, Darragh Granahan (15), from Gort Community School, for his work, Unconditional Love. In the 12-13 age category, first prize (\u20ac350) went to Mayo\u2019s Charlotte Greham (12), from Breaffy National School, Ballina, for her artwork, Inspiration. Emily Coffey (11) won first prize in the 9-11 age category, for her piece called Gone But Not Forgotten. First prize for the 7-8 age category (\u20ac200) was won by Clare student, Sin\u00e9ad Azkorbebeitia (8), from Ennis Art School, for her self-portrait. The youngest age group in the Competition \u2013 6 years and under \u2013 was won by four-year old Louth student, Tadhg Traynor, from Rainbow Club, Drogheda, for his work entitled Dog. The prize for his work was \u20ac150. In a separate category G, first prize of \u20ac1,500 was won by James Moonan (18), from The Arthouse, Drogheda, for his work entitled The Wren\u2019s Nest. A multiple previous winner, Moonan also won first prize in Category G of the Competition in 2023, 2021, 2020, and in 2019, second prize in 2018, and Special Merit Awards in 2022 and 2017. James Twohig, director of Ireland operations at Valero Energy (Ireland) \u2013 the company that markets fuel in Ireland under the Texaco brand \u2013 thanked the adults who \u201cencourage children to see in art an outlet through which to demonstrate their individuality and unique talent and ability\u201d. \u201cDespite the many worldly attractions and devices that vie for the attention of today\u2019s youth, it is extremely gratifying to know that many continue to show an enduring interest in art and to demonstrate their ability in the magnificent prize-winning entries we see today,\u201d he said. The Texaco Children\u2019s Art Competition is regarded as the longest-running sponsorship in the history of arts sponsoring in Ireland, with a history that dates back to the very first Competition held in 1955. This year was its 70th year running.

            "raw_text": "Picture the scene: four people sit around a pub table tucking into a meal. One of them begins to choke on a shard of glass. Her companion leaps up, slapping her back, scanning the room for help. All the while, a small CCTV camera at Judge Roy Beans in Newbridge, Co Kildare records the show. Its footage proves revealing: moments before her apparent distress, the woman is seen reaching into her top, removing the glass and carefully placing it in her mouth. \u201cPeople think they can get away with making outrageous insurance claims, a belief supported and encouraged by some within the legal sector and facilitated by insurers settling dubious claims,\u201d said P\u00e1draig Cribbeen, chief executive of the Vintners\u2019 Federation of Ireland (VFI), which later posted the footage on social media to demonstrate what many of its members must deal with. Although the example was used to highlight the threat of so-called \u201ccompo culture\u201d, many businesses in Ireland say they continue to experience unduly expensive premium costs for a variety of reasons, despite comprehensive reforms in the sector. As well as hospitality, the outdoor adventure and other niche or \u201cpinch-point\u201d sectors complain of excessive fees.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 [\u00a0 Legal costs make up 41% of litigated public and employers\u2019 liability injury settlements \u00a0] At the heart of debate around public liability insurance lies the insurer who claims cover is historically loss-making and the customer who claims Government-driven reforms have not been passed down, and greater competition is vital. While eagerly anticipated Central Bank data later this month should provide insights into how the liability sector has performed since insurance reforms have bedded in, many customers remain frustrated. \u201cThe adventure activity sector in Ireland continues to suffer an existential crisis due to the cost of obtaining affordable public liability insurance and, sadly, more and more operators are closing,\u201d said Brendan Kenny, chief executive of Ireland\u2019s Association for Adventure Tourism (IAAT) which represents various outdoor pursuits companies. Although the organisation, formed in 2017, created a safety management system for its members, it says they continue to pay premiums up to six times the rate of those across Europe. \u201cOne of our German colleagues said recently that what we pay for insurance would cover the insurance costs of the entire sector, high ropes specifically, in Germany,\u201d said Bill Cremin, managing director of Zipit, a company offering treetop climbing activities in counties Dublin, Roscommon and Cork, with annual insurance costs of a quarter of a million euro. Sector research conducted by the IAAT, which has over 230 members, shows two-thirds (65 per cent) of operators have seen their premiums increase since 2019, despite much-trumpeted market reforms. The average premium increase was 45 per cent. [\u00a0  Adventure centre owner removes \u2018anything that causes injury\u2019   \u00a0] Given that one in five (19 per cent) operators have been unable to secure cover for all of their products, the majority of IAAT members say improving market competition is now the priority. In the equine world, the Association of Irish Riding Establishments (AIRE) has found similar concerns among its members. One said: \u201cWe have to be grateful to receive a quote at all, never mind price or conditions.\u201d Although not considered to be at the same existential level, hospitality businesses have also complained about insurance costs and poor comparisons with other countries. At its annual conference last year, the Irish Hotels Federation\u2019s then president Elaina Fitzgerald Kane appealed to the Government to address the \u201cexcessive and escalating cost\u201d of insurance, citing an average increase of 20 per cent in premiums for the year, in the immediate aftermath of Covid-19 and its effects on the sector. \u201cWe are the laughing stock of Europe in terms of the cost of insurance for business. When you look at Germany, Denmark [they] don\u2019t have the same compensation culture,\u201d said Adrian Cummins, chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI). \u201cA lot of work is being done but it\u2019s not being done fast enough.\u201d [\u00a0 Insurers urged to immediately lower premiums after Oireachtas passes new law restricting occupiers liability to visitors \u00a0] Compared to the adventure activity sector, which puts insurance at as much as 12 per cent of turnover, the restaurant industry estimates its insurance cost as about 5 per cent. Cummins concedes that while it is a problem, insurance is not among the most pressing issues, which include inflation, VAT and energy costs. At Scholars Townhouse Hotel in Drogheda, Co Louth, owner Mark McGowan estimates he has had about 12 personal injury claims over 18 years. \u201cWe have to take out a loan for our insurance this year. It\u2019s the first year we\u2019ve had to do it,\u201d he says. \u201c[It] has gone right up to \u20ac44,000. We\u2019re a 16-bedroom hotel; I\u2019ve a 40-seater lounge and I have about a 60-seater restaurant. So with the turnover we\u2019re doing, it doesn\u2019t make [sense]. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left for the business owner any more. All we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re working for the Government, we\u2019re working for insurance, we\u2019re working for our staff, we\u2019re working for everybody else.\u201d F\u00e1ilte Ireland, which promotes the domestic tourism market, has felt the need to weigh in. A spokeswoman said the problems in securing cover was having a \u201csignificant impact on businesses\u201d in the sector. \u201cNot only does this have implications in terms of the negative economic impacts, it also has the potential to seriously undermine Ireland\u2019s overall tourism offering,\u201d she said. \u201cOur analysis shows that the insurance difficulties facing tourism SMEs in Ireland is unique to us.\u201d Ireland\u2019s domestic insurance industry is worth \u20ac4.6 billion. While it largely functions without issues, the Government published a sweeping plan for reform of the industry at the end of 2020. With ambitions to lower costs, tackle fraud and increase market competition, its 66 actions have been the subject of three implementation reports. Big changes were brought to the judiciary, where compensation awards have been considered excessively high in the past. In April 2021 the Book of Quantum \u2013 which guided payouts \u2013 was replaced by new personal injury guidelines. By the following June Sean Fleming, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, set out evidence the move had already delivered. Average public liability and other awards made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), the body that deals with all initial claims, during the first eight months since the guidelines were drawn up, had dropped by over 40 per cent. By then, the average PIAB award was slightly below \u20ac14,000 compared to almost \u20ac24,000 in 2020. Almost three-quarters of awards (72 per cent) were for under \u20ac15,000, compared to just 30 per cent in 2020. Another significant piece of legislation overhauling Ireland\u2019s duty of care laws is expected to further ease the strain on costs. The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, signed into law earlier this month, amends the Occupiers\u2019 Liability Act by rebalancing the duty of care to visitors and recreational users. In plain terms, it will address the dreaded \u201cslips, trips and falls\u201d and shift more weight toward personal responsibility. [\u00a0 Woman withdraws claim of up to \u20ac60,000 after CCTV shows her slamming brakes \u2018for no obvious reason\u2019 \u00a0] Nevertheless, the Department of Finance has conceded some activity-related sectors, including hospitality, are facing difficulties. \u201cThe international liability insurance market has shown signs of hardening in recent years, with consequent effects on availability and premium prices,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cAs a small, open economy with multilayered connections to the global economy, Ireland has been particularly impacted by this.\u201d The department notes that data from the National Claims Information Database (NCID) has shown the liability market to be loss-making for years. Added to that, \u201cniche sectors\u201d have traditionally been reliant on UK underwriters but this has been upended by Brexit-related bureaucracy and costs. These are positions echoed by the industry itself, which pushes back against any notion of arbitrarily high premium costs. Even in a reform era, both say there is no silver bullet. \u201cThere are difficulties in some of these niche, pinpoint sectors but I suppose the context from an Insurance Ireland perspective is the liability market has been challenging for insurers over the past decade or more,\u201d a spokesman for the umbrella organisation said, adding that some had left the market. \u201cWe are seeing a reduction in claims [through PIAB] but that will take time to feed through to premiums. We are probably at an inflection point where some of these changes are bedding in and we [have to] see when the benefits will come to realisation for some of these sectors.\u201d Over the last 10 to 12 years, he said, such niche businesses found themselves \u201ceconomically unviable\u201d in the eyes of an insurer, due to costs, including legal fees for settling claims. Insurance Ireland is more cynical about claims of excessive policy costs in the hospitality sector, which it sees as a \u201cdeflection tactic\u201d from the high-cost business environment, particularly hotels. The spokesman said the reason Ireland is considered more expensive than other European countries is \u201cmultifaceted\u201d. Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance point to last year\u2019s NCID report from the Central Bank which showed that in 2020, 92 per cent of employer and public liability, as well as commercial property policies, cost less than \u20ac5,000. \u201cBut the same report pointed out that all sectors had seen increases\u201d in premium costs, noted Brian Hanley, the recently appointed chief executive of the Alliance for Insurance Reform. While optimistic, Hanley appears eager to contextualise progress. \u201cLocal reform [in Ireland] should have had a much bigger impact on local liability insurance costs,\u201d he says, emphasising the customer experience that, whatever about intent, not everyone has reaped the reward. \u201cThere is a huge degree of frustration that it hasn\u2019t. There has been a whole-of-society effort to do something about insurance premiums. \u201c[It] hasn\u2019t been passed on to members. You see some modest reduction perhaps in motor but certainly from talking to members there is nothing in EL [employers\u2019 liability] or PL [public liability] to date.\u201d Hanley accepts Brexit arguments but he is quick to counter others. It comes down to competition, he says, a market shortfall currently being addressed by a specialised unit working out of the Department of Finance. Whatever the ultimate solutions, Hanley believes those corners of Irish life that struggle to find insurance should not be pigeonholed, sent into a corner on account of their niche status. \u201cTo call them pinch-point sectors in some ways is to diminish their value,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is at least some [activity] cancelled every week. You read in the papers that they can\u2019t go on, they can\u2019t continue, it\u2019s not possible for it to happen. They might be relatively small in scale but they\u2019re part of our culture, part of our tourism offering, part of our identity.\u201d",

            "date": "2022-11-15",
            "raw_text": "People are being left out of pocket for sometimes expensive medical procedures because of confusion over the extent of their private health cover and the nature of pre-existing conditions, according to the financial services and pensions ombudsman. In a report focusing on private health insurance published on Tuesday, the acting ombudsman, MaryRose McGovern, said it was important that consumers understood the extent of their health insurance cover and the waiting periods that could apply for new cover or after an upgrade of a policy. \u201cWe are approaching the time of year when many people will be thinking about reviewing or renewing their private health insurance, or indeed perhaps switching providers, particularly in light of the current cost-of-living pressures,\u201d Ms McGovern said. She noted that private health insurance \u2013 costing on average \u20ac1,410 per adult annually \u2013 \u201ccan represent a significant amount of a household\u2019s budget\u201d. \u201cIt is vital that consumers take some time, before starting the renewal process, to make sure they understand the impact of any decisions they make in upgrading or downgrading their cover,\u201d the acting ombudsman said. She said the more than 300 plan options across different providers meant there was \u201ctremendous choice, but it can be a challenge to select the best level of cover to suit individual needs\u201d. Market research undertaken by the ombudsman\u2019s office found that just 15 per cent of private health insurance policyholders felt they had a good understanding of the cover of their specific plan, with 27 per cent saying that they had only a poor understanding of their cover. The report provides summaries of 21 decisions made in complaints over private health insurance between 2018 and 2022. They include a woman who received just short of \u20ac70,000 over an insurer\u2019s decision to decline cover for treatment in another EU state. The ombudsman found the insurer\u2019s assertion that its medical advice group had considered \u201call available literature\u201d before determining the proposed treatment was \u201cnot consistent with a proven form of treatment for her condition\u201d was \u201cmanifestly incorrect\u201d, and also criticised a 3\u00bd month delay in letting her know the decision. However, other cases were rejected on the grounds that a person had upgraded their policy to cover their condition only after taking initial diagnostic tests and, separately, that tests showed a condition pre-existed the taking out of a policy at all and was thus limited by a five-year waiting period. Among the issues highlighted in complaints to the ombudsman\u2019s office was a lack of awareness among consumers that medical investigations, X-rays or blood tests undergone before private health cover was taken out could result in a condition being defined as being pre-existing. \u201cThe policyholder may not believe that there was a pre-existing condition, because it had not been given a name at the time of the investigations. It is important for consumers to be aware that a pre-existing condition can exist, without a formal diagnosis, and it is the signs and symptoms within the period, which are relevant,\u201d Ms McGovern said. She acknowledged that issues surrounding health insurance were often \u201cfraught with additional worry and stress, very often during a period when the people involved can be feeling very unwell\u201d. \u201cHealth insurance policies will not cover you for every eventuality, so it is worth taking some time now, to familiarise yourself with your cover and its associated waiting periods before you need it,\u201d the ombudsman advised. \u201cIt is important that customers do not wait until they have symptoms to take out private health insurance and then expect to be covered for those illnesses.\u201d",

            "title": "Quiet quitting: You always had workers who did 9-5 but it\u2019s a creeping malaise, employers say",
            "author": "Olive Keogh",
            "date": "2024-04-25",
            "raw_text": "About two years ago the term \u201cquiet quitting\u201d was added to the workplace vocabulary. It refers to employees who are no longer willing to go the extra mile for an employer and it was widely considered a knock-on effect of the pandemic. In fact, quiet quitting is not new. Employees have always had the option to reduce their effort if they felt undervalued or overworked. What the pandemic did was bring this resistance right out in the open as many resented the extent to which work had seeped into their personal lives during lockdown. Once a semblance of normality returned, they started kicking back. What employers have found since is that quiet quitting is worse than the inconvenience of having an employee leave. Quiet quitters are hard to handle, both on the job and in performance reviews, because they continue to complete their assigned workload to the same (often high) standard, giving their managers an uneasy feeling but nothing specific to complain about. Quiet quitting is subtle, unspoken and slippery to tie down, but a straw poll of managers suggests it is a lot more prevalent post-pandemic. \u201cYou always had those who did their 9-5 but not a minute more and never chipped in if there was a crisis. But it\u2019s become like a creeping malaise with a sort of passive-aggressive undercurrent that\u2019s really exhausting,\u201d says one manager in charge of a large finance team in a busy multinational business. \u201cTheir attitude also has an impact on colleagues who are affected by the downbeat vibe and having to pick up the slack. Post-Covid, people are definitely less prepared to start early or work late and less willing to put their hand up if there\u2019s something extra to be done.\u201d At one level it\u2019s reasonable to ask why should they? They are apparently fulfilling their employment obligations to the letter if not the spirit and if an organisation is constantly relying on employees to put in extra hours to make the business model work, it is going to be in big trouble when that goodwill runs out and it can hardly be surprised that it does. Job creep, where people end up doing tasks outside the original scope of their role, is a fact of life. However, part of the problem now is that many employers failed to \u201crecalibrate for more normal times\u201d when the pandemic was over, say organisational behaviour expert Prof Anthony C Klotz, from UCL School of Management in London and Mark C Bolino, professor of international business at the University of Oklahoma\u2019s Price College of Business. Writing in the Harvard Business Review, the duo say that, \u201cafter more than two years of pandemic-fuelled firefighting, during which more and more activities that might once have been considered \u2018above and beyond\u2019 have become expected parts of workers\u2019 jobs, the benefits of citizenship behaviour may increasingly feel outweighed by the costs\u201d. \u201cGoing above and beyond can come at a cost for employees,\u201d they add. \u201cIn a healthy organisation, these costs are typically counterbalanced by benefits such as increased social capital, wellbeing and career success. The quiet quitting trend suggests that employees are increasingly feeling that this exchange has become unbalanced: employers are demanding additional effort from workers without investing in them enough in return.\u201d Klotz and Bolino say that employers need to review employees\u2019 responsibilities and decide what is core and what is extra. They also suggest that the withdrawal of effort may be linked to fatigue because employees don\u2019t feel supported \u2013 something that could be tackled relatively easily by asking them (individually) what supports would help. Being flexible is important here as people have different needs depending on age, responsibilities outside work and life stage. \u201cAs a manager in my 50s, I\u2019ve been around the block a few times and I have a certain sympathy for the quiet quitters,\u201d the finance manager says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to deal with while keeping everyone else engaged. In particular it\u2019s a challenge to ensure that the first job employees on the team don\u2019t assume this behaviour is the norm. [\u00a0 Big disconnect between employers and staff on hybrid work, report finds \u00a0] \u201cThe other thing that\u2019s becoming apparent is a level of thinly veiled anger among those in the 35 to 45+ age bracket. This is not about the job per se, although they go off like firecrackers if there\u2019s any suggestion that something like the hybrid working arrangements might change. It\u2019s more related to the pressures they\u2019re under outside work but it spills over and people are definitely more tetchy. \u201cThe pandemic tested everyone\u2019s resilience. People became really ill, they had to mourn family members in very difficult circumstances and some of my team are suffering from long Covid so the fallout is still being felt in the workplace. [\u00a0 Long Covid services are \u2018pot luck\u2019 for sufferers, TDs told \u00a0] \u201cBut whatever\u2019s going on for my crew, I still have my KPIs to meet so I can only be understanding up to a point. I actively encourage my team to avail of our employee assistance programmes and I try to lead by example by doing a relaxation class at lunchtime (provided on-site) or going outside to get some air if it\u2019s not lashing down. \u201cI also keep back some of my budget to spend on small rewards like sweet treats when everyone is in the office, buying eggs at Easter or standing them the occasional lunch. I\u2019m not naive enough to assume these gestures will sway the quiet quitters, but for some of my team they make a difference and in the words of the ad: every little helps.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

            "raw_text": "There will be changes to the law on duty of care under proposals aimed at reducing insurance which have been approved by the Cabinet. The aim of the planned insurance reforms is to balance a property owner or business\u2019s duty of care with personal responsibility of customers or members of the public. T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar said the plans are an \"important part of what we are doing to make insurance more available and less expensive for customers, community groups, clubs and businesses and to give them more choice of insurers.\" He added: \u201cI believe it strikes a new, fairer and more reasonable balance, between the steps an owner or operator of a premises must take to keep their customers and visitors safe, and what individuals themselves can be expected to take responsibility for when entering a business, club or community building\u201d. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the amendments contain four \u201ckey developments\u201d. They will see a number of recent court decisions which rebalance the duty of care owed by occupiers to visitors and recreational users inserted into primary law. There will be a change to the standard to clarify that when the occupier of a property has acted with reckless disregard for a visitor or customer, it is the standard of reckless disregard rather than reasonable grounds which should apply in relation to any consideration of liability. Limits to the circumstances in which a court can impose liability on the occupier of a premises where a person has entered onto premises for the purpose of committing an offence will be brought in. And the amendments will also allow for a broader range of scenarios where it can be shown that a visitor or customer has voluntarily assumed a risk resulting in harm. Ms McEntee said: \u201cThe combined effect of these developments is intended to lead to further reductions in insurance premiums, building on the success of the personal injuries guidelines introduced last year.\u201d The Government is now proceeding to draft the proposed legislation, which will be placed before the Oireachtas for enactment as part of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.\"",

            "title": "Matt Williams: Time to refine current red card laws in the interests of rugby justice",
            "author": "Matt Williams",
            "date": "2024-04-26",
            "raw_text": "Like all high-functioning communities, rugby has laws, not rules. These laws are based on the principle that our officiating and judicial system will act justly. The more egregious the offence, the more stern the punishment. It is a system that requires both logic, balance and wisdom. Currently, when contact is made with another player\u2019s head, no consideration is given to whether the contact was accidental or premeditated. All head contact receives the bluntness of a red card. The joy of playing and watching rugby is that our attacking players are moving at high speed, in a chaotic unpredictable environment, making split-second decisions centimetres before making contact with an opposition player, who is attempting to physically take them to the ground, while functioning in the same chaotic state. In that environment, accidents will happen. The red card handed to New Zealand\u2019s captain Sam Kane during the RWC 2023 Final was the perfect example of an accidental collision. Kane was chasing South Africa\u2019s Jessie Kriel, when Kriel unexpectedly and brilliantly changed direction in searching for a gap. Does rugby need the 20-minute red card? Kriel\u2019s split second brilliance robbed Kane of three metres of space and he simply did not have time to adjust. When he collided with Kriel he accidentally made contact with the ball carrier\u2019s head. The match officials acted in accordance with the laws as they currently stand. Kane was yellow carded, and this was subsequently upgraded to a red. However, many in the rugby community believe that while the laws were correctly enforced, justice was not done. When I first played our game there were only two sanctions \u2013 a penalty and a sending off. There were no free kicks or coloured cards. For more than a century it was an exceptionally rare and shameful occurrence for an international player to be sent from the field because it was usually for an act of real violence. As our game evolved, administrators began to realise that rugby\u2019s complex set of laws required more nuance to the sanctions to deliver justice. That generation of exceptionally wise administrators introduced the free kick as a lesser sanction to a penalty, for all technical scrum infringements. Unlike the injustices we witnessed at the recent World Cup, where technical scrum infringements resulted in penalties that ultimately determined the world champions, in the past, under those just and now wrongly-jettisoned laws, teams could not score points from forcing technical scrum infringements. With the growth of what is now termed \u201cprofessional fouls\u201d, and what we use to simply call cheating, the yellow card was conceived to boot some justice into the backsides of those who constantly and deliberately broke the laws. The motivation for all of these changes to sanctions was aimed at delivering justice to our players, spectators and supporters. World Rugby will soon consider a proposal to globally trial a law variation on red cards that in many people\u2019s opinion, including mine, have been successfully implemented in Super Rugby. This law variation aims to refine the current red card laws and deliver justice in our high-velocity contact sport that is desperately and correctly attempting to reduce concussions. Let us be totally clear. The proposed laws in no way minimise the game\u2019s commitment to reducing illegal contact to player\u2019s heads. What the proposed law trial does provide is nuance for officials to rule if a player made accidental contact to another player\u2019s head. If so, the offending player will still be sent from the field and cannot return. The refining piece of legislation is that after 20 minutes of being a player down their team can replace the offender. Any coach will tell you these remain large sanctions. If this law was in use at RWC 2023 Sam Kane would have remained off the field but the Kiwis could have sent on a bench player 20 minutes after the incident. Crucially the trial law provides justice to the game, because every player who has ever laced up a boot understands that there is a huge difference between reckless, deliberate or dangerous body contact and accidents when players simply get their time and space wrong. Importantly, the law also nullifies the ridiculous time wasting that forces our referees to tediously watch replays of incidents before making huge, game-changing decisions. Instead, the proposed law variation provides the TMO, who does not have the pressure of being on the field, with the time to review the evidence and make an informed decision. Our refereeing community does not like the concept of empowering TMOs to make decisions without the input of the on-field referee. While I understand their concerns, we only have to look at how Rugby League uses its version of the TMO to make highly-accurate decisions much faster than rugby, to see that our officiating must evolve faster in that direction. While rugby\u2019s laws must change to rid itself of the stigma that the game causes brain injury, there are several other far more crucial areas of law than the proposed red card variation that must be changed to accomplish this mammoth task. The results of the laws being trialled in New Zealand that enforce all contact in tackles to be below the sternum are proving highly positive. As statistics show that concussions have drastically dropped under what is being called \u201cthe Sternum law\u201d, we can predict these laws will be universal at some point in the near future. [\u00a0 A rugby match where 30 forwards take to the pitch is not a good thing for the game \u00a0] Reform is also essential as to how replacements are utilised to ensure aerobic fatigue returns to our forwards, so there are fewer high-speed collisions from fresh giants being sprung from the bench and the concept of the horrendously titled \u201cBomb Squad\u201d is banished from the game. All red cards need to be supported with far longer periods of suspension and the introduction of hefty fines on individual offenders to increase the deterrent. Practices that has been successfully implemented in both Rugby League and AFL. Before RWC 2019, World Rugby\u2019s legislators acted with good intentions but great haste in changing the red card laws regarding contact to the head in an attempt to reinforce player safety. These proposed law variations from Super Rugby are about refining those decisions that, under the law of unintended consequences, have pushed rugby\u2019s scales of justice out of balance.",

            "raw_text": "New York-based insurance broker NFP has moved to double the amount of business being written by its fledgling Irish operation by acquiring ReSure Corporate Brokers in Dublin for an undisclosed sum. NFP, which is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Investment Partners, entered the Irish market in 2020 through the purchase of HMP Insurance and Pension Advisors and followed up last year with the purchase of Aiken Insurance. The purchase of ReSure, which was itself only established two years ago, will almost double the Irish operation\u2019s annual gross written premiums, based off 2021 figures, to \u20ac50 million, according to a spokesman for NFP. He added that NFP is also exploring \u201cfurther potential acquisitions\u201d, as consolidation of the sector in the Irish market has ramped up in recent times. ReSure's directors Aidan Brady, Ross Barron and Garry Fitzroy, who each previously worked with global broker Lockton's Irish operation, and its 11 other employees will continue in their roles. ReSure\u2019s business to date has focused on complex insurance risk placements in industries such as recycling, real estate, construction, corporate restructuring, domiciliary homecare and financial lines. It is currently on track to see its gross written premiums rise to \u20ac30 million in 2022 from \u20ac24 million last year, according to the statement. News of the deal comes days after Kerry-based Gallivan Murphy Insurance Brokers said it had agreed to be bought by a private equity-backed US insurance broking group, called Assured Partners, in a deal believed to be worth more than \u20ac100 million. Flurry of deals The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past five years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms. Assured Partners is controlled by GTCR, a Chicago-based private equity company. The attraction for financial investors lies in the fact that insurance broking is a fee-based business that delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle, and strong cash flows that allow buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. The most active dealmaker in recent times has been Arachas, whose name is Irish for insurance. Arachas was itself acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a UK brokerage group that, like NFP, is backed by Madison Dearborn and HPS.",

            "raw_text": "Campion Insurance, one of the largest insurance brokers in the State, is set to be acquired by UK-based PIB Group in a deal estimated to be worth more than \u20ac70 million, as consolidation within the industry continues apace. The deal, confirmed by PIB in a statement on Monday afternoon, shortly after The Irish Times reported the development, is the UK group\u2019s third purchase of a retail insurance broker this year in the Republic. PIB entered this segment of the market in April with the purchase of Wexford-based broker Creane & Creane and followed up last month with the agreed purchase of Waterford-based Oliver Murphy Insurance. The Campion and Oliver Murphy deals remain subject to regulatory approval. PIB said that is has \"several more acquisitions under consideration\". The UK group, which was founded in 2015 and is backed by private equity firms Apax Partners and the Carlyle Group, entered the Irish wholesale insurance market in late 2017 through the purchase of Citynet Insurance, a Lloyds of London broker operating in the UK and Irish market. It followed up in 2019 with the purchase of another wholesale intermediary, Optis Insurance. Family business Established in Urlingford, Co Kilkenny, in 1984 by Jim Campion as a family business, Campion Insurance is a specialist in commercial and personal insurance as well as life and pensions. While representatives for PIB and Campion declined to comment on the value of the deal, industry sources put it at more than \u20ac70 million. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Campion Insurance will soon become part of the PIB Group which is a positive and exciting development in our history,\u201d said Mr Campion (60), who will continue to lead the business with his existing management team. \u201cIt is testament to the hard work of our dedicated people and loyal customers who are behind our success to date, that we are in the position to play a key role in driving PIB\u2019s expansion in the Irish market. We are excited about what lies ahead, and very attracted by the opportunity to continue our acquisition activity through the strength and scale offered by PIB.\u201d There are about 1,200 general insurance and financial brokers in the Republic \u2013 mainly family-owned businesses. However, the sector has seen a raft of deals in recent times, fuelled by strong valuations being achieved in the industry, issues over succession planning in some businesses, and the prospects of scale offering opportunities for back office and compliance savings. Consolidation has also been a big theme in the sector internationally. Arachas, the acquisitive Irish brokerage group that was bought last year by larger, private equity-backed UK peer Ardonagh Group for about \u20ac250 million, has subsequently continued on its own deals trail, with transactions this year including an agreement to buy Waterford-based Hooper Dolan for a consideration believed to be more than \u20ac60 million. Another driver of consolidation in recent years has been Innovu, the insurance brokers group backed by MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland.",

            "raw_text": "Will  Aviva \u2019s re-entry into the Irish health insurance market after an eight-year hiatus bring down prices for consumers? We can only hope so given the drift upwards since the pandemic ended a couple of years ago. At the very least it might bring some stabilisation in premium costs, which in itself would be a relief. Health insurance premiums rose by an average of 10 per cent last year to \u20ac1,594, according to the  Health Insurance Authority  (HIA), amid a rising number of claims and costs. This was in advance of inflation. A third terminal at Dublin Airport - urgent necessity or pie in the sky? State-owned  VHI , and Axa-owned  Laya  have increased their coverage costs again in the early months of this year. In addition, about 130,000  VHI  members will be forced to change their healthcare cover, with the insurer set to axe some of its most popular plans next month. We can only assume that the plans weren\u2019t achieving the right margin. Aviva intends to enter the market in the second half of this year, via a joint venture with experienced industry executives, including former VHI boss Oliver Tatten and Jim Dowdall, who led Irish Life Health. The expectation among brokers is that Aviva will target large corporates in a bid to get scale and credibility. There is also the potential for cross-policy discounts being offered on Aviva\u2019s range of general insurance policies. If you were to listen to VHI, Laya and Irish Life Health, there is no money to be made in the private health insurance market here. And yet French insurer Axa last year paid \u20ac650 million to acquire Laya, while Irish Life spent big in the past decade to carve out its position in the market (including buying out Aviva Health in 2016). And we can only assume that British insurer Aviva is making this move because it sees a good opportunity to make money. Hopefully there will be upside for consumers, too.

            "raw_text": "I presume that the Irish Embassy in Australia, located here in its capital, Canberra, is kept busy. They\u2019re duty-bound to help you (probably \u2013 I\u2019m not sure so don\u2019t read that as legal advice of any kind). If your son is visiting and is arrested outside Aldi (yes, we do have Aldi here) for brandishing a traffic cone while running down a public thoroughfare in his underpants screaming, \u201cUp Mayo!\u201d because he lost a bet with his friend Dodgy Brian, you\u2019d go straight to the only consecrated Irish soil in Canberra, I\u2019m guessing. Whether or not your son deserves help, you\u2019ll probably need advice to prevent deportation and intergenerational shame falling upon the entire county of Mayo. And yet, here I find myself in the eye of a diplomatic incident almost as serious as the traffic cone thing. The ripple effect could damage trade relations. The Irish Times has journalists the world over. They gather reports as events unfold. They are expected to deliver sophisticated geopolitical analysis, and I\u2019m no different. It\u2019s tough, highly skilled work. It\u2019s risky, but it\u2019s for the good of the country. Someone has to muster the grit to get it done. To be in the room. Ask the tough questions. Doggedly pursue truth at any cost. We do it in the name of good, honest journalism, and we do it for Ireland. So when my editor emailed me urgently in the middle of the night (every email from home is in the middle of the night in Australia but I\u2019m enjoying the drama) and asked, \u2018can you find a spice bag in your local area?\u2019, I heeded the call to serve. He had, after all, requested in writing. That constitutes a legal contract, probably. I thought of my beloved family, safe in their beds at home in Limerick. I thought of how shaky things have been since Leo\u2019s resignation. I thought about the spice mix restaurants put on the chips and the crispy chicken, the onions and peppers and the whole business, and I thought, \u201cI\u2019m a patriot. I\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m not technically The Irish Times\u2019s Australia correspondent, but after this, I surely will be.\u201d \u201cYeah, okay, sure I\u2019ll have a go,\u201d I replied casually because I didn\u2019t want to intimidate my editor or make him feel guilty about the potential safety implications of dispatching me on such a critical mission. Spice bag diplomacy \u2013 it sounds like a pejorative term coined to describe the mandate of the Department of Foreign Affairs under former taoiseach Charles Haughey. The Canberra Irish Club is the Hibernian hub here and a crucial resource for people who enjoy mashed potatoes with gravy in the local community Here\u2019s the crisis \u2013 I cannot find one. Not in my local area, anyway. Here in the heart of Australia\u2019s verdant capital city, people have apparently not yet discovered the spice bag and my heart is broken for want of one. The Irish in Australia are industrious. A quick glance at Reddit (because of research) reveals that my editor and I are not the first to speak truth to power and ask the hard questions. On the Reddit Sydney thread, someone seeks advice on where they can find this Irish delicacy. They go on to clarify, \u201cI\u2019m talking the real greasy, cholesterol-raising good sh*t\u201d, presumably alluding to the concerning rise in some Dublin gastropubs trying to gentrify the spice bag, serving it in artisanal recycled wax paper, sprinkling it with peanut rayu, fiddling with the sacred spice mix, or committing other heresies. [\u00a0 Irish staples - the chicken fillet roll and spice bag - a sellout success in London \u00a0] The root of the spice bag lies not in Foxrock, but in true multiculturalism \u2013 in enterprising Chinese restaurant owners realising that if you put chips in it (it being whatever you have to hand to experiment with, like breaded chicken, peppers and other bits around the kitchen), Irish people will eat it. We need the inclusion of potato to feel safe. Dip it all in curry sauce but know you may become overwhelmed and fall spontaneously to your knees. Those brave innovators understood this and a beautiful fusion cuisine was born. The Reddit questioner is promptly directed to BIG Dave\u2019s Irish Chipper (I\u2019ve kept the capitalisation in to accurately report Dave\u2019s name as he spells it himself because I\u2019m a respectable journalist). It\u2019s apparently open every day \u2018till 8pm and you can sit in if you\u2019re feeling elegant. I\u2019ll be heading in on my next trip to Sydney in the name of research and forwarding the bill to The Irish Times. The accounts people may ask unreasonable questions, such as: \u201cWhy does this receipt have $300 in curry chips on it?\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t have to put up with this sort of thing from you, you\u2019re not Fintan O\u2019Toole\u201d. (I either fever-dreamed or read somewhere that Fintan has to be forcibly extracted from a plate of curry chips, Orwell Prize or not). You can\u2019t just wander the streets of an Australian city asking strangers if they know where to find a spice bag. You might be cautioned for soliciting, or someone could misunderstand and try to sell you synthetic marijuana. So I start knocking on doors. That is to say, I consult the Canberra Irish Club menu to look for spice bags. I do this because the Irish Ambassador very concerningly refused to give me an official quote on the scandal, arguably based at least partially on the fact that I felt too embarrassed to request one. Another veteran journalist (maybe Fintan O\u2019Toole or possibly Miriam Lord) might demand that the ambassador either personally account for this gaping hole in the Irish cultural outreach agenda or promptly resign, but I don\u2019t have that sort of integrity. The Canberra Irish Club is the Hibernian hub here and a crucial resource for people who enjoy mashed potatoes with gravy in the local community (also Irish culture and whatnot). No spice bag was found, but they do make a lamb curry in McDonnell\u2019s curry sauce which sounds as intriguing as it does unwise. They also offer a plethora of potato wedge options, which is a real comfort at this stressful time. Journalists aren\u2019t supposed to engage in overt activism so I\u2019ve consulted The Irish Times\u2019 lawyers as to whether I\u2019m allowed to petition the club to add spice bags to the menu. In the meantime, I\u2019ll be picketing the Embassy and eating nothing but dry chips (like a common goat) until the spice bag arrives in Canberra \u2013 meet me out the front to sign my petition if you\u2019re around. More as it happens.",

            "title": "Health insurance Q&A: What exactly happened this week and what does it mean for me?",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2024-02-04",
            "raw_text": "When it comes to health insurance, it takes a lot to shock Dermot Goode. He has been working as a broker and analyst in the sector for many years and has successfully predicted countless price moves by all the players in the space but the size of the increases averaging 7 per cent rolled out by  VHI  Healthcare earlier this week caught him off guard. \u201cWe were expecting more increases, we weren\u2019t expecting another 7 per cent,\u201d he says. He notes that in times past, if a company imposed a big increase, if they followed up with a subsequent hike it would be smaller. \u201cTo follow a 7 per cent average with another 7 per cent average is not what we were expecting,\u201d he says, and points out that some of VHI\u2019s plans are going up by closer to 10 per cent while others will be losing some cover as part of the shake-up. But the State\u2019s largest provider of private health cover has not being acting alone and its latest increase is part of a trend that has prices soaring for Irish consumers and \u2013 often \u2013 the level of cover offered falling. What exactly happened this week? The VHI, announced price increases which it said averaged 7 per cent. The increases kick in from March 1st. The move comes on top of a similar increase the company imposed in October. That seems steep? The company blamed a post-pandemic surge in demand and the  cost-of-living crisis  and said the increase was \u201cnecessary to meet the healthcare needs of members as claims volumes have risen by more than 20 per cent in 2023 and inflation has had a significant impact on the cost of delivering healthcare\u201d. It also pointed to \u201cadvances in drugs, procedures and other medical innovations and technologies, supporting enhanced healthcare outcomes\u201d. What does it mean for me? That depends. The cumulative impact of the two hikes will see some policies climb by close to 20 per cent. In cash terms, that could see many families made up of two adults and two children  worse off by well in excess of \u20ac500  while individuals on some of the older and more expensive plans could be facing increases of more than \u20ac700 per person. What does it mean if I have just renewed my policy with the company? The good news is that the new increase will only impact the price you pay on your next renewal date. Anyone whose 12-month annual contract with the company is due for renewal before March 1st will only feel the pain of the October hike and it will be a full year before the impact of the latest increase is felt. [\u00a0 What is the true cost of the cost-of-living crisis for households? \u00a0] My contract expires at the end of March \u2013 could I renew now instead and get locked in at a lower price? No. But the VHI is not the only company increasing its prices, is it? Absolutely not. Shortly before Christmas  Irish Life Health announced a third price increase in just 10 months . The company said that from January 1st its prices were going up by an average of 4.8 per cent, although some policies increased by 6 per cent. Irish Life Health, which has some 500,000 customers, increased its prices last March and again in July, with a cumulative increased cost for some policies of up to 15 per cent. And last August Laya Healthcare rolled out price increases averaging just 3 per cent \u2013 although some of its policies climbed by about 5 per cent. Five per cent? That\u2019s a bargain. You might want to wait and see what happens next. Companies don\u2019t flag their price hikes in advance but a notable feature of the health insurance market is that when one company increases its prices the others follow suit soon afterwards. The smart money would suggest that Laya\u2019s prices will increase again sooner rather than later. Do many people have health insurance? As of last September, 2.48 million people in the State had private health insurance. That\u2019s 46.8 per cent of the population, according to the Health Insurance Authority (HIA). What can I do to save money? The key to saving is shopping around either with your existing provider or with one of the others ahead of your next renewal date. But not many people do that. Recent research published by the HIA showed the vast majority of Irish consumers have never switched health insurance provider despite the potential savings to be made. The average length of time people have stayed with their current provider is 15 years with those over 55 often paying significantly more as a result of being on the same policy for a long period of time. What does significantly mean? People over the age of 65 typically pay between 40 and 45 per cent more for cover than younger people. They are also less likely to switch, which puts them at higher risk of being on dated plans. It is also frequently the case that the older the plan, the higher the price. [\u00a0 Cost of living crisis: Have we reached peak prices? \u00a0] But switching is complicated, right? There are more than 300 different plans to choose from, all of which cover a dizzying array of potential conditions and options. On top of all that, most of us are pretty risk-averse when it comes to our health. It is entirely understandable to be afraid of making a mistake by switching to a policy that does not cover what we need when we need it. And this fear comes into sharper focus if you have a pre-existing condition and are concerned that by switching you might lose cover or have to wait for coverage to kick in. The good news is that much of the complexity is easy to sidestep and it is probably harder to get wrong than many people might think. What do you mean by that? There are strict rules in place that give consumers protection irrespective of their age or health issues. A person who has a long-standing policy with Company A will have already been through their waiting periods and can switch to Company B and get all the existing cover they had with Company A immediately. To put that more simply, you do not lose the cover you already have by moving from one company to another. And unlike other forms of insurance, you cannot be penalised financially because of pre-existing conditions or your age. So what should I ask if I contact my provider? Ultimately, the questions can be distilled down to three \u2013 although please do ask more. The first question is: \u201cDoes the plan I am on offer me value for money?\u201d The second question is: \u201cCould I get a comparable level of cover for less either with my current provider or one of its two competitors?\u201d And the third question is: \u201cHow long have I been on the same policy?\u201d If the answer to that last question is more than five years, then you are probably overpaying by about 25 per cent. [\u00a0 Wholesale electricity prices fall by 68% but consumers yet to benefit fully \u00a0] But I have been with the same company for years. Do I have to switch to a different one? No. The first step is to call your current provider to see if they have a lower-cost equivalent plan to the one you are on and say you are happy to take on some minor reductions, depending on the savings. Your existing insurer will already have a complete record of all previous claims you have made, so the simplest question to ask is whether any new and cheaper plans would have covered all the claims that have been paid out over the last two years and to the same level. If the answer is yes, then your choice is pretty simple. And if the answer is no? You could call the other providers and see what they offer. When you make that call be upfront, bearing in mind you will not be penalised for honesty. Detail all the key elements of your existing policy and outline any underlying conditions and procedures carried out. Have them confirm that any new and cheaper plan will cover everything you have had covered in the past. Apart from the price hikes, you mentioned the VHI was cutting back on some cover? Goode has noted some policies have seen a reduction in what is offered, particularly on corporate plans. Examples of cover being lost on some plans will see 50 per cent benefits for GP visits change to 50 per cent to a maximum of \u20ac40 per visit. Meanwhile, 75 per cent benefits will change to 75 per cent to a maximum of \u20ac60 per visit. When it comes to consultant visits on the impacted plans, 50 per cent benefits will change to 50 per cent to a maximum of \u20ac125 per visit while 75 per cent benefits will change to 75 per cent to a maximum of \u20ac190 per visit. Day-to-day excess has climbed too, something that will impact all members immediately, Goode says. At present, the excess on your annual outpatient claim is \u20ac1. This will now increase to \u20ac10 per member from March onwards. So what can I do? At the risk of repeating ourselves, the best way to approach an era of price hikes is to shop around. And ask questions about better value and lost cover.

            "raw_text": "Hospital consultants are working at \u201cmaximum capacity\u201d and the new public-only contract \u201cwill not, in and of itself, solve the chronic problems the health service is facing\u201d, the Irish Medical Organisation has said. On Friday, The Irish Times reported  concerns from the Health Service Executive  (HSE) about whether hospitals and community healthcare organisations (CHOs) are \u201cderiving the necessary benefits\u201d from the new public-only consultant contract. The contract, which seeks to remove private healthcare from the public system, also intends to enhance senior decision maker presence on-site, out of hours and at weekends. However, earlier this month, Damien McCallion, chief operations officer at the HSE, wrote to the chief executives of hospitals and CHOs stating \u201cweekend and extended day working arrangements\u201d in the pre-agreed areas \u201cneeds to be demonstrated\u201d. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 He said a national oversight group was established to oversee implementation of the contract had identified \u201ca significant number of sites where no obvious benefits are being derived despite large numbers transitioning to the contract\u201d. In a statement on Friday, the IMO said it is \u201cnot realistic\u201d to infer the health service will see \u201ctangible benefits\u201d if consultants are consistently rostered outside \u201c\u2018normal\u2019 working hours\u201d. The chronic deficit in hospital bed occupancy levels in particular was highly dangerous and was leading to serious overcrowding across the system \u2014 Prof Sadlier Professor Matthew Sadlier, chair of the Consultants\u2019 Committee of the IMO, said if consultants are obliged to work odd hours, then clinics at other times will have to be cancelled as there is a significant lack of doctors to provide cover. \u201cThere are hundreds of consultant posts that remain vacant or filled on a temporary basis, and the consultants in our system are working at maximum capacity. There is no room for manoeuvre unless major investment for more doctors and more beds, along with significant structural reform and realignment, are provided,\u201d he said. Prof Sadlier said consultants are not currently facilitated to provide optimal care to all patients \u201cgiven our chronic shortage of beds, inadequate access to diagnostics and an unmanageable waiting list backlog\u201d. \u201cThe chronic deficit in hospital bed occupancy levels in particular was highly dangerous and was leading to serious overcrowding across the system,\u201d Prof Sadlier added. According to the most recent figures, almost half of the consultant workforce is now on the new public-only consultant contract, which was introduced in March last year, despite opposition from both the IMO and the Irish Hospital Consultants\u2019 Association. Under the contract, consultants can be asked to work 8am to 10pm from Monday to Friday and 8am to 6pm on Saturday as part of their core 37-hour week. Any private work they do has to take place outside their rostered hours, away from the public facility. Basic pay under the contract ranges from \u20ac217,325 to \u20ac261,051 on a six-point scale, with additional pay for on-call duties and overtime, and supports for medical education training and research.

The company, the Irish subsidiary of the UK\u2019s largest independent brokerage Ardonagh Group, said in a statement on Monday that the deal will increase its European footprint. It will also strengthen the Irish company\u2019s connection to Brokerslink, a global network of brokers of which L\u00e9ons is a founding member and shareholder, the company said. L\u00e9ons Group specialises in full-service insurance solutions to corporate clients and, the company said, works in complex cases and international operations. The broker, owned by the L\u00e9ons family who will retain a stake after the acquisition, will continue \u201cto operate independently as part of Ardonagh Europe under the direct leadership of Sunny and Nico L\u00e9ons\u201d, Ardonagh said. \u201cWe are excited to welcome L\u00e9ons to Ardonagh, together building on their Dutch roots and solid reputation in the market to build a portfolio of brands and insurance broker companies that are leaders in their target markets,\u201d said Ardonagh Europe chief executive Conor Brennan.

With its headquarters in Dublin, Ardonagh Europe is the European division of the private equity-backed Ardonagh Group, which in 2020 bought Irish broker Arachas Corporate Brokers for \u20ac250 million. Arachas had itself been one of the most active dealmakers in the Irish brokerage market in what has been a period of unprecedented consolidation over the past four years or so, closing deals for a host of companies including sports and events specialist O\u2019Driscoll O\u2019Neil, Waterford-based Hooper Dolan and Stuart Insurances. More recently, Ardonagh Europe has been gearing up to move into new European markets, appointing a managing director for Italy to assist with its planned expansion there latest this year.

            "raw_text": "Leading motor insurers have agreed with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to boost compliance with competition law following a long investigation. Here's what it means and how it happened. What have motor insurers done? Motor insurers AIG, Allianz, Axa, Aviva, FBD and broker AA Ireland have agreed with State regulators to improve their compliance with competition rules following an investigation. Will this cut my motor insurance costs? Ultimately it should, but no one can say your premium will fall 10 per cent when you renew cover. Instead the likelihood is that the move will improve competition between the companies, which make up 70 per cent of the market, forcing them to cut prices over time. Who investigated the companies? The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the State agency responsible for supervising and enforcing competition law. What did it investigate? Allegations of an illegal practice called \u201cprice signalling\u201d. This is where rival companies let each other know in advance that they are increasing charges, allowing further price hikes across their industry, pushing up costs for all customers. What started it? Detailed public statements from insurers through 2015 and 2016 about future price increases. Surely lots of businesses announce price increases? Yes, but on standard products and services with set rates. Each individual insurance policy is different \u2013 theoretically anyway \u2013 as the risks vary between customers, so uniform hikes should not necessarily apply in this business. What did the CCPC find? In September 2020 it issued preliminary findings to the companies alleging that each had engaged in anti-competitive co-operation over 21 months. What did the companies say? They denied this, saying they had their own compliance measures in place, but the CCPC argued that these were inadequate as they failed to flag potentially anti-competitive practices in the first place. Why did this take so long? Investigators had to deal with a huge amount of detail, internal documents and other material from the businesses involved, as well as interviewing 55 individual witnesses. So what happens now? The six companies have agreed to reform their compliance practices to help prevent any breaches of competition law in the future. Independent experts will monitor this. Each organisation\u2019s pledge is legally binding, meaning they could face court action if they fail to honour any part of it. What did they agree to do? Provide an internal system to detect and report likely breaches of competition law, protection for any whistle-blower who might come forward, appoint compliance officers who report to their boards, staff training and yearly submissions to the CCPC showing each continues to honour the deal. Did everyone sign up? No. Brokers Ireland, formed in 2017 from the merger of the Irish Brokers\u2019 Association (IBA) and Professional Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association, has not. Why not? Its chief executive, Diarmuid Kelly, says the commission never proved that the IBA, one of its predecessor organisations, engaged in anti-competitive behaviour. He maintains that the CCPC has not responded to the association's detailed rebuttal of its preliminary findings, issued in November last year. What has the CCPC said about this? Brian McHugh, the commission member responsible for competition enforcement, argued that Brokers Ireland had an obligation to address the IBA\u2019s conduct, which gave rise to concerns. Had the organisation signed an agreement, that would have demonstrated its commitment to future compliance. Is this it for insurers? No. The CCPC has written to the Central Bank highlighting concerns about the industry. The commission says it has invested considerable time and resources investigating the industry and its business practices. While this inquiry has ended the commission says it is \"in no way giving the industry a clean bill of health\".",

            "raw_text": "Presidents get some strange requests, but surely few as strange as the request made to president Patrick Hillery in 1978, which related to the robbery of a princess's family jewels at gunpoint in a Dublin house. The president was asked if he could help in any way as the princess tried to deal with an insurance company following the incident. Princess Christa von Preussen of Prussia, who was the great-granddaughter of the last German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was visiting her friends Cecil and Renata Coleman at Monte Alverno, Dalkey, when the home was broken into by armed robbers on June 28th, 1978. The details of the incident were set out in a newly released letter sent to Dr Hillery by the Irish consul general in Bavaria, Liselotte Linnebach, in November 1978. She said the princess, and other guests who had arrived for dinner, were tied up by masked men with machine guns. The princess's family had lost all its fortune during the two World Wars, the diplomat explained, but the princess still had some family jewels. \"She took her last family jewels with her to Ireland, and they were all robbed!\" The items stolen included gold chains, necklaces, brooches and bracelets as well as many precious stones, including diamonds and sapphires. The newly released file relating to the incident also contains a letter from Princess Christa to Mr Coleman in which she placed a value of 38,195 Deutsche Marks on the pieces of jewellery stolen and added that her companion Hanns had items stolen that were valued at 3,900 DM. The combined losses equal \u20ac21,500, although this does not take into account more than 40 years of inflation, which could treble that sum. \u201cAfter the unbelievably horrible experiences which Hanns and I suffered in your house on June 28th, I was glad to have a sign of life from you . . .\u201d the princess wrote to Mr Coleman. Recoup losses Meanwhile, Ms Linnebach told Dr Hillery the relevant ambassadors had been told about the incident and efforts were being made to recoup the losses through insurance. \u201cThe shock the princess has had cannot be compensated in all her life!\u201d the consul general wrote. \u201cShould you be able, dear President, to help in this matter I would be most grateful. Perhaps you know the Chairman of the insurance company.\u201d She told Dr Hillery that the princess \u201cin her modest aristocratic way\u201d had not talked about the unpleasant affair because she did not want to damage tourism and business links. She had \u201ca great fancy for Ireland and spends her holiday every year there\u201d. The president\u2019s office sent the letter to the department of the taoiseach, who forwarded it to the department of justice due to the criminal nature of the matter. Renata Coleman confirmed the details of the case to The Irish Times last week and said Princess Christa had been visiting Ireland for Derby week when the burglary happened. The IRA was thought to be involved. Princess Christa was an old family friend and was alive and well, Ms Coleman said. The princess is now 85. Ms Coleman, a businesswoman and horse breeder, is from Bavaria, like the princess. She said many of the items stolen from Princess Christa were irreplaceable family heirlooms and were never recovered. Diplomat burglaries The documents were among State papers released to the National Archives that also contain incidents of burglaries affecting diplomats in Ireland. A cultural attache at the Japanese embassy reported the theft of his one-year-old Honda Integra in 1989, while the home of a French diplomat was burgled in 1982 and the thief made off with a Grundig radio and a handbag. The residence of the Iranian embassy\u2019s first secretary was unlucky enough to be burgled for a second time in 1991. The embassy wrote to the department of foreign affairs to complain and pointed out that other diplomats at the embassy had also been victims of burglaries. \u201cSince the provision of necessary security measures for all diplomats resident in Ireland is the responsibility of the Government, the Embassy expects the Department of Foreign Affairs to issue the necessary instructions to the relevant authorities as soon as possible for the appropriate security measures to be taken,\u201d an Iranian official wrote.",

            "raw_text": "The \u201cfire risk\u201d at the Stardust nightclub was deemed \u201cpretty horrendous\u201d by an insurance company\u2019s fire-surveyor weeks before a blaze caused the deaths of 48 people at the north Dublin venue in 1981, inquests into the deaths have heard. Richard Williams, who worked for Hibernian Insurance (now Aviva) from 1961 to 1997, told Dublin coroner\u2019s court on Wednesday he recommended turning down insurance cover to the Stardust in 1979 and 1981. He conducted a fire survey there in 1981. \u201cThis involved checking on construction, linings, etc but did not include patron safety. I duly reported on the fire risk, which I deemed as pretty horrendous, and recommended that we did not quote, so it was turned down again.\u201d He had previously declined to quote for the Stardust in 1979, when he worked in underwriting, on reading a colleague\u2019s fire survey. The inquests have heard the Stardust had insurance through another company. Mr Williams was giving evidence on day 80 of fresh inquests into the deaths of 48 people, aged 16 to 27, following a fire in the early hours of February 14th, 1981. Asked by Mark Tottenham, BL, for the coroner, why he thought the fire risk \u201chorrendous\u201d the witness said the Stardust building could have been considered a \u201creasonably good fire risk\u201d as it was a solid concrete construction. \u201cBut it was made worse by the combustible products put into it.\u201d He said a new cold room behind the main bar, in the northern part of the building, was \u201chighly combustible\u201d as its walls were filled with polystyrene foam insulation with an aluminium skim. \u201cWhen we saw the cold room I realised there was a serious danger involved in [electrical] arcing in that particular area,\u201d he said. He also had concerns about the materials used to line the ballroom\u2019s internal walls and the ceiling tiles. Earlier, Anthony Pasquetti, who had begun evidence on Tuesday reiterated his account of seeing \u201c10 foot\u201d flames through the roof at the north of the Stardust at about 1.38am \u2013 from his family home nearby, minutes before a flame was first seen inside the venue. When he and a neighbour got to the front of the Stardust, by about 1.45am, emergency services had not arrived but did \u201cabout five minutes\u201d later. At first, he said no one was exiting the building, but he soon saw kitchen staff coming out. He recognised two neighbours among them. There were a few older people coming out of the Lantern Rooms function room with drinks. It was a \u201cfew minutes\u201d before he saw younger people exiting from was exit 3, behind the stage area, he said. Fergus Kane, 18 at the time, was at the Stardust with his girlfriend, and friends Bernard Hogan, Eugene Hogan (24) who perished and Mr Hogan\u2019s wife Marie. Eugene and Marie, who had two infant daughters, had been due to move to Co Kerry on February 15th, 1981, as he had been offered a job. The five had been dancing when Mr Kane heard a \u201csigh\u201d from the crowd. He looked around to see a small fire in an area of tiered seating in the West alcove. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big and didn\u2019t look like it was going to be too hard to put out. He advised his girlfriend, Eugene and Marie to leave while he and Bernard went to get the coats and bags. At that stage \u201cit seemed fairly calm and relaxed but people were making their way to the exits\u201d, he said. As they got to coats he turned around and \u201cvery thick black smoke billowed out from where the fire started\u201d. He had difficulty breathing and the lights failed. Unable to see he ran towards a door with the coats over his head against the smoke. He fell. \u201cI tried on three occasions to get to the door but was overcome on each occasion by smoke. When I was on the ground I found it easier to breathe,\u201d he told the court. He could feel air \u201cthrough a gap\u201d indicating he was near a door. He got up and tried to open it \u201cbut there was a chain on it ... It wasn\u2019t budging. I was hitting the door with my shoulder and nothing was happening\u201d. He ran at the door and fell. He came across a number of people \u201cmotionless\u201d on the floor. \u201cI ran at it again but the flames were up near the door at this stage. There were droppings from the ceiling like hot wax\u201d and the smoke was overwhelming him. I then got down beside and eventually this door opened. \u201cI saw the beam of a torch shine in ... I got up and ran towards the beam,\u201d he said. He got out exit 5, at the side of the dance-floor. \u201cThe fire had scorched the coats at this stage. I burned my nose, two ears, my back and took in a lot of smoke.\u201d The inquests continue.",

Quinn Insurance Ltd was put into administration in 2010 and some 23 reports have been presented to the High Court over the years by joint administrators Michael McAteer and Paul McCann of Grant Thornton outlining progress on the orderly winding down of its business. On Friday, Mr Justice David Barniville ordered that, following a resolution, the company be wound up and a formal petition for the wind-up could be presented to the court as part of the normal liquidation process. He also approved what was the 23rd and final report presented to the court by the joint administrators of the firm which included the setting out their costs and fees for the last year. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 The judge thanked the joint administrators for the work they did on \u201ca very difficult and complex administration\u201d. He was thankful on his own behalf and that of his predecessors who had dealt with reports from the administrators over the last number of years. The application to approve the winding up was made by Garvan Corkery SC, on behalf of the administrators, on an ex parte (only one side was represented) basis. Counsel said the application was in circumstances where effectively the administrators had taken on the role of the former Quinn directors and the court took on the role of the shareholders. Counsel said there remained some outstanding matters relating to accounting and aspects of the insurance which will still be dealt with by the administrators but it had been resolved to seek the winding up. Counsel read from an affidavit from Mr McAteer outlining the course of the administration including the transfer of the various arms of the business \u2013 general and health insurance \u2013 to Liberty and Catalina insurance companies. He said proceedings brought against Quinn\u2019s auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for allegedly negligent auditing of the firm were ultimately settled. PwC, which was sued for \u20ac900 million, had denied the claim. Quinn maintained its authorisation with the Central Bank but that is no longer required and will be withdrawn with the making of the winding up order, he said. The cost of the administration will be of the order of \u20ac1 billion, the court heard.",

Social Democrats TD R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall said it was \u201cnot good enough\u201d that key details about fee payments to administrators Grant Thornton and their advisers remained unpublished, three days after the company was  wound up with a High Court liquidation order . The failure of the business, established by bankrupt former billionaire Se\u00e1n Quinn, in 2010 cost taxpayers some \u20ac1 billion, with all motor and home insurance policyholders paying surcharges to fund its losses. Still, it is only now that the extent of professional fees paid during the insolvency process are coming to light. Professional fees Ms Shortall called for the release of Grant Thornton records after The Irish Times \u2014 citing Companies Office filings, private data and the administrators\u2019 23rd and final report to the High Court \u2014 reported that the insurer\u2019s demise  led to some \u20ac100 million in fees for accountants and lawyers  who worked on the administration and litigation linked to it.

[\u00a0 Quinn Insurance administrators got \u20ac375 per hour over 10 years for their work \u00a0] Both Grant Thornton and administration solicitors McCann FitzGerald refused to provide the reports, although Grant Thornton said the documents \u201cshould be available\u201d by asking the court. However, the court said it could not release them because exhibits such as the reports were not in the case file. \u201cIt is unacceptable that details of the costs of the administration of Quinn Insurance are not a matter of public record. In fact, it appears that efforts are under way to bury the details of those costs,\u201d said Ms Shortall. The Social Democrats finance spokeswoman said the fallout from the company\u2019s collapse came under the remit of Minister for Finance Michael McGrath and Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney. \u201cBoth Ministers should confirm whether their respective departments have had sight of the reports or if they are in their possession.

            "raw_text": "Ryanair is selling travel insurance policies on its website which will be invalidated if people fly with the airline for non-essential journeys while Government restrictions on travel overseas remain in force. A clause in the travel insurance policy offered by the airline makes it clear that people will not be able to make claims if anything happens while they are overseas if they have travelled outside of Ireland contrary to advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The relevant exclusion clauses say cover will not be offered for any claim \u201carising directly or indirectly from you travelling against Foreign Office (or any government body) advice or where it is deemed unsafe for you to travel\u201d. As it stands the official advice from the Government is that non-essential journeys overseas should be avoided. Another clause in the Ryanair travel insurance document says there will be no cover for \u201cepidemics or infectious diseases; infectious diseases caused by a virus belonging to the coronavirus family such as SARS and coronavirus Covid-19\u201d. Travel insurance exclusions denying cover to people who travel contrary to official guidance are the norm across the sector. But it is somewhat unusual that many of the insurance policies sold could immediately be invalidated once a person leaves the country. When contacted about this the airline declined to respond to queries from The Irish Times. Pressure In recent days Ryanair has been increasing pressure on the Government to ease restrictions on people flying to and from Ireland by suggesting there has been a surge in Irish bookings for destinations in the sun for July and August. In an interview published on Monday, intended for a UK audience, chief executive of the airline Michael O\u2019Leary said British people were booking outbound flights for holidays despite quarantine requirement, but Europeans were not coming to Britain. Asked whether Ryanair would cancel July and August flights if the UK quarantine remained in place during those months, O\u2019Leary said: \u201cNo, because the flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this quarantine, they know it\u2019s rubbish.\u201d A spokesman for the airline told The Irish Times that the same trend was being noted amongst Irish customers, despite a quarantine requirement here, as well as an official advisory from the Department of Foreign Affairs warning against non-essential travel. \"The same applies [in Ireland]. We're seeing a surge in bookings to holiday destinations such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, both from the UK and Ireland,\" the spokesman said. While the airline talks about a surge in bookings to European tourist destinations for the weeks ahead, the reality is that many of the seats on flights bound to Spain, Portugal and Italy this summer will have been sold to Irish families who had plans in place long before the pandemic hit.",

            "raw_text": "Laya Healthcare has become the latest healthcare provider to announce price increases. The company said the average increase would be in the order of 7 per cent of the gross premium across its schemes. The price increases will be applied to policies from April 1st, 2024. Many customers of Laya Healthcare have already seen the cost of their polices climb by more than 10 per cent as two separate increases announced last year kicked in. Irish Life customers who have renewed since last summer also saw two increases applied to their policies.

This a limited term offer where members can pay for one child, and the rest go free. Commenting on the pricing review D\u00f3nal Clancy, managing director at Laya Healthcare, said that while demand for healthcare has reached an all-time high, so too has the cost of delivering care. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the highest volumes of claims in two decades and the highest cost of claims in over 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular, activity in private and high-tech hospitals has accelerated and across the board and we\u2019re seeing record levels of demand among our members for healthcare services\u201d.

            "author": "Jack Horgan-Jones",
            "date": "2024-04-27",
            "raw_text": "\u201cRwanda threat is pouring migrants into Ireland,\u201d screamed the headline on the front page of Friday\u2019s Daily Telegraph. Leaning on quotes from T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Tory-leaning British broadsheet picked up on the surprising statistic disclosed by the Irish Government this week that 80 per cent of recent asylum seekers arriving into the State had crossed over the Border from Northern Ireland. The newspaper jumped on Martin\u2019s linking the influx to the UK government\u2019s controversial policy of threatening to deport migrants to the central African nation of Rwanda, a policy that was passed by Westminster on Tuesday. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the impact it was designed to have,\u201d Martin was quoted by the Telegraph as saying. [\u00a0 New laws needed to deal with asylum seekers arriving into State from North, says Taoiseach \u00a0] The report gave voice to concerns about an open border into the Republic and the impact of a contentious immigration policy in a neighbouring country and the movement of migrants into this one. \u201cIrish people like a degree of common sense,\u201d Taoiseach Simon Harris told the Oireachtas finance committee on Wednesday. \u201cIt is important in the weeks and months ahead to show the people of this country that we have a rules-based migration system.\u201d Harris was speaking the day after his Minister for Justice Helen McEntee put in a patchy performance at the Oireachtas justice committee, which gave rise to several key moments. She was unable to give a clear answer to Independent TD Michael McNamara over why asylum seekers had not been returned to countries willing to accept them, and then made the stark assertion that formed the basis of the Telegraph\u2019s story three days later: more than 80 per cent of people seeking asylum in the State are believed to be coming across the Border. Voters who apparently want to believe that the system is rules-based and common sense may have been left scratching their heads. The idea of a leaky Border back door \u2013 or of a system that is not fast enough or efficient in dealing with failed applications \u2013 is anathema to the prevailing political winds on immigration. McEntee had given an otherwise confident defence of Ireland\u2019s decision to opt in to the EU\u2019s migration and asylum pact over three hours before the committee. But colleagues at Cabinet now see her moving centre stage as the debate on migration spreads beyond accommodation. \u201cThe politics has moved to Justice and away from [Minister for Integration] Roderic [O\u2019Gorman],\u201d says one Minister, with McEntee now facing the prospect of being the political fulcrum. With 100,000 refugees and asylum seekers now in State-provided housing, there is a new emphasis on the Border \u2013 how people move into the country, and what happens afterwards. It comes against a backdrop of simmering tensions on migration that boil over with increasing frequency. Pressure on the migration is now unprecedented. The belief that a huge percentage of people are coming across the Border has been discussed in senior Government circles for some weeks now The 80 per cent figure is not a hard data point. After McEntee\u2019s assertion, even officials on the British side were grasping around trying to figure out what it was based on. Asked for comment, the British embassy issued a fairly terse one-line statement, saying there remained a high level of co-operation on migration, asylum and border security between the UK and Ireland. The figure is in fact an extrapolation from the percentage of people who claim asylum at the International Protection office on Mount Street, Dublin, which has shot up in recent months, rather than at a port of entry. It is a sort of proxy measurement, based on the strong view among officials in the Department of Justice that the overwhelming majority claiming asylum in Mount Street can only be coming across the Border. Department of Justice figures suggest 5,161 applications had been made to the end of March, meaning more than 4,100 were made at Mount Street, with the overwhelming majority supposedly coming from Northern Ireland. Given the Border is open, one official said: \u201cWe will never have accurate numbers.\u201d The belief that a huge percentage of people are coming across the Border has been discussed in senior Government circles for some weeks now. However, getting a firm answer on what is driving it is difficult. A Government source working in the area says the assumption is that many who are presenting \u2013 many of whom are Nigerians \u2013 had some sort of status in Britain, whether a visa or asylum. The prospect of the UK\u2019s Rwanda policy \u2013 where asylum seekers are flown to the east African country while being processed \u2013 coming into effect is another. A third source says officials have speculated that changes to family reunification rules in the UK for lower-skilled migrant workers could be encouraging family members to come here and travel back to Britain. Another suggestion is simply that with asylum seekers travelling to the UK in huge numbers, a small percentage of that is going to trickle across to Ireland. Others believe that word-of-mouth effects spread quickly and there may be some theory about Ireland or its system behind the rise, or that bad actors \u2013 people smugglers and organised crime gangs \u2013 may be engineering passage to Ireland across the Border. The truth is probably that all of the above, and other factors, form a potent cocktail. Security sources say \u2013 in a view mirrored in political circles \u2013 that part of the reason is the effectiveness of Garda operations overseas, checking documents at embarkation at key airports. The feeling is this has forced people away from airports and airlines to an extent, but given the scale of migratory pressures, that flow is merely dispersed elsewhere. This presents a different problem. Garda\u00ed can inspect trains and buses, but the length of the Border and sheer number of crossing points \u2013 an argument emphasised by the Irish side during clashes over Brexit \u2013 stack the odds against them. \u201cThe airport piece is actually easier than the North-South piece,\u201d says one security source. [\u00a0 Visa-free travel from South Africa may end under immigration plan \u00a0] Similarly, as pressure begins to mount over the number of people the state actually deports, the garda\u00ed will point to the challenge of actually locating people who have been in the State for many years if, as some expect, the political system begins to demand more action on this front. The hard political truth, however, is that the Coalition must now be seen to be doing something about it. \u201cWe have a serious systems failure around processing times and upholding the rules as we have them,\u201d says a Cabinet source, criticising the Department of Justice for being \u201ccompletely hands off\u201d, failing to develop capacity or structures over years and appearing \u201coverwhelmed, ineffective and inefficient\u201d. Since the elevation of Harris as Taoiseach, Government rhetoric on immigration has shifted away from the perennial problem of accommodation, and towards firmer measures that might reduce the flow into the State \u2013 in keeping with an emphasis Harris had when he was in the Department of Justice. The Taoiseach said as much on Thursday, emphasising that the accommodation situation \u201cis an outworking of our migration policy\u201d. This chimes with the \u201cback to basics\u201d and \u201ccommon sense\u201d threads to Harris\u2019s nascent premiership. Consistent with his style, there has been a steady drumbeat of policy announcements or flagged interventions. These include further countries being added to the \u201csafe country\u201d list for accelerated processing; new legislation to \u201cfix\u201d the current situation where people coming from the UK cannot be immediately returned due to an Irish High Court ruling that the UK cannot be designated a safe third country; the inclusion of countries (Nigeria, in the first instance) with high numbers of asylum seekers for faster processing alongside safe country applicants; a mooted suspension of visa-free travel from South Africa \u2013 something that is said to have been on Harris\u2019s to-do list in Justice but that languished since. Sources in Government Buildings say to expect more announcements in the coming weeks, a focus on trying new things, on pace and on new deterrent measures. And yet, for all the urgency and dizzying ambition, room for manoeuvre is limited. Overhauling something as complex as immigration policy is difficult to do quickly, and Harris has 11 months at most until the next general election. [\u00a0 More than 80% of asylum applicants now coming from UK via Northern Ireland, says McEntee \u00a0] The migratory trends seem tidal, and continues despite changes on the ground. Fewer single men and more families are coming since the State ran out of capacity to house all who arrive, but the overall number is shooting up. Similarly, the department has made significant strides in improving decision times on applications and appeals \u2013 something seen as key to suppressing numbers arriving from certain jurisdictions \u2013 but overall the trend line still reaches skyward. McEntee indicated last week that returns to the UK could resume after a relatively quick legislative fix \u2013 but if the Rwanda policy comes into full effect, would the Irish courts stand over sending people back? Could the Government? The relentless pace of the migration story shows no signs of yielding. Quite the opposite. On Thursday night, garda\u00ed clashed with protesters in Harris\u2019s Wicklow constituency. Next week the Oireachtas justice committee will embark on expanded hearings into the migration pact. With D\u00e1il and Seanad motions on the opt-in shifted back a week, the Rural Independents have put down a motion objecting to the pact, heralding more news cycles and scrutiny, which the Government, in its defence, says it welcomes. On Monday, McEntee will meet her British counterpart James Cleverly, with Harris promising closer co-operation between the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the two governments. Against the backdrop of a rapidly shifting challenge \u2013 and McEntee\u2019s comments \u2013 they will have much to discuss.

            "author": "Mon Jan",
            "date": "2021-01-18",
            "raw_text": "January is a time for new intentions and looking to the year ahead. Optimism and change are in the air. It\u2019s also a time of year when fresh starts and resolutions around health concerns and health care are top of mind. If getting or switching health insurance is something you\u2019re considering, you can receive free, impartial information from the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), a government body that is a statutory regulator of the private health insurance market. The   Health Insurance Authority's online comparison tool  is a great starting point. We caught up with a consumer affairs specialist from the HIA for some added advice on how to use the tool. Q: What kind of information does the Health Insurance comparison tool give? A: We're independent and we provide information to consumers on private health insurance. Our   new online comparison tool  was launched in 2019, and is a great starting point for consumers looking to review their policy. You can use it to compare your current policy, or if you're new to private health insurance, you can research all the options on one website. Often people will get plan recommendations from friends and families, or the insurers themselves, and they use this as a starting point. Q: What information do I need to have to hand? A: If your policy is up for renewal, go to '  Compare your current plan ', and all you need is the name of your policy. Plans will appear on the comparison tool that closely match the price of your existing policy. A lot of options can still appear, but you can narrow down the selection by using the filters down the left hand side. By using the \u2018Cover Options\u2019 section you can reflect your plan requirements more accurately and reduce the number of plans being shown. For example, if day-to-day cover is important to you or if cardiac or orthopaedic cover are priorities, you tick those options to filter your original results further. You can also filter plans based on hospital type, plan type, excess level and price. You can look at four plans side-by-side at one time. You might have to do more than one comparison. The purchase of private health insurance is an important decision and you should therefore consider how the results relate to your particular circumstances, and check the full plan and price details directly with the relevant insurer before making your choice. Q: When you first land on the Health Insurance comparison tool, it also gives options for Cash Plan and Out-patient Only. What are these? A: A cash plan provides a fixed monetary amount for a range of medical costs but does not provide comprehensive in-patient cover. Out-patient plans provide cover for a range of out-patient expenses including GPs, consultants and alternative practitioners. Both cash plans and out-patient plans provide money back for day-to-day and out-patient expenses. So if a consumer is mainly concerned with cover for these types of expenses, rather than comprehensive in-patient cover, they can be a good choice. Q: What\u2019s a good average for in-patient excess to start with on the slider? A: In-patient excesses can be as high as \u20ac600 or as low as \u20ac50. The higher the excess, the lower the premium will be. The average cost a consumer spends on a policy is around \u20ac1,200, which would have an excess of \u20ac150 - \u20ac300. Q: Why would someone want to prioritise private hospitals? A: If someone decides, for their own personal reasons, that they would like to prioritise private hospitals, they should be mindful of the hospitals covered under policies, as not all private hospitals will be covered. Q: Does preferring a private room add a significant cost to a premium? A: It can add on to the cost of premiums but there may not be a significant difference. Also remember, a private room is not guaranteed as it depends on the rooms hospitals have available at the time. Q: How much leeway should consumers give on the budget slider? A: We would suggest that a consumer needs to consider how much they would like to spend and also consider how much they can afford. It is important to note that the prices shown are today's prices as have been notified to the HIA. The price and plan details do not reflect scheduled changes which have not yet been implemented. For information on future price and/or benefit changes, please see   our Latest News Section  on the website. Q: Can users save searches for future reference? A: No, but you can print your searches or share them by email. That way you can have details to hand for future reference. [\u00a0 online health insurance comparison tool \u00a0] Alternatively, call 1850 929 166 to speak to a consumer affairs specialist.

            "raw_text": "Scores of patients with advanced cancer are losing out on access to the newest and most promising treatments because of their choice of private health insurer. The plight of public patients forced to wait long periods for access to next-generation therapies is widely acknowledged but a separate access issue has developed over the past four years between customers of the three main health insurers. In 2019, VHI broke ranks with its rivals by agreeing to fund wider access to cancer treatments for private patients. Irish Life Health and Laya Healthcare, which elected not to follow suit, generally wait for a drug to be approved on the public system before greenlighting it for customers. [\u00a0 Cancer doctors accuse insurers of denying patients access to new drugs \u00a0] Since then, the number of new drugs, and the number of indications of these drugs for different cancers, has multiplied, leading to what oncologists say is a growing disparity in coverage between different providers. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 \u201cExisting insurance customers and those considering taking out insurance do need to realise that there is a substantial imbalance in coverage for cancer between VHI and the other two companies,\u201d says Prof John Crown. This is reflected in the experiences of cancer patients who have talked to The Irish Times about the difficulty they have experienced accessing treatment through their insurer. What is the benefit in having Irish Life or Laya insurance if you need treatment for metastatic cancer? \u2014 Prof Ray McDermott Mary O\u2019Loughlin, from Boolavogue, Co Wexford, is unable to access immunotherapy to treat her cancer because the drugs her consultant recommends are not funded by the HSE or her private health insurer. Mary was diagnosed with a rare form of gastric cancer two years ago and has undergone extensive chemotherapy and surgery. Faced with a recurrence of the disease, her oncologist, Prof Ray McDermott, recommended the use of pembrolizumab or nivolizumab to treat it. It is \u201chighly likely\u201d her tumour will respond to this form of immunotherapy, he told The Irish Times. \u201cI was delighted, but then Irish Life said they don\u2019t cover it,\u201d Mary says. \u201cThe VHI will cover it, and the HSE don\u2019t want to know about it for certain cancers.\u201d Prof McDermott asks: \u201cWhat is the benefit in having Irish Life or Laya insurance if you need treatment for metastatic cancer, specifically a drug that has been shown to work and is recommended in all useful guidelines? In my view subscribers should know this when they choose their insurance plan and act accordingly.\u201d Mary is now back on chemotherapy, for which she travels from her home in Co Wexford to St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Dublin every second week. \u201cIt\u2019s going very hard on me. Chemo is much harder than the immunotherapy \u2013 there\u2019s awful fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hair loss and a feeling of being generally unwell,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least I\u2019m having it, but it would have been much better if I could have been given the immunotherapy. I\u2019m wondering why we can\u2019t have it in Ireland.\u201d She says she didn\u2019t have the strength to take up the issue with her insurer but a family member helped her appeal the decision to refuse cover for pembrolizumab. Irish Life declined the appeal, and also said it \u201ccannot allow\u201d an exception on compassionate grounds. Ironically, Mary used to be with VHI but was switched by her broker to Irish Life 16 years ago; the broker receives a 3 per cent commission from Irish Life each year. She believes brokers should let clients know \u201cwhat\u2019s definitely not covered\u201d before moving them to another health insurer. While she could switch back to VHI next time she is renewing her policy, use of the immunotherapy would not be covered for the first two years under standard health insurance switching terms. [\u00a0 Nurses in 26 cancer treatment centres proving a valuable resource \u00a0] Anita O\u2019Connell believes the refusal of her health insurer, Irish Life, to fund a potentially life-changing treatment for her cancer is \u201cextremely unfair\u201d when it is available through another insurer, VHI. After the 52-year-old woman was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018, she was treated with aggressive chemo, surgery and radiotherapy. Her scans were clear for two years but then she experienced back and bone pain and required further treatment. Prof Crown recommended a course of sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy), a new drug from Gilead Sciences that regulatory bodies in Europe and the US have approved for the treatment of secondary breast cancer. Clinical trials have shown it can slow progression of the disease by several months and extend a person\u2019s life by about five months compared with traditional chemotherapy. However, her insurer, Irish Life, refused to pay for the treatment, on the basis that it is not reimbursed by the HSE. \u201cI was extremely disappointed and very frustrated,\u201d says Anita. \u201cI felt my access to a life-changing drug is dependent on the randomness of the insurance company that my husband happens to be in, through his work. \u201cTime is not on my side. It is frustrating to think the people making these decisions probably do not have first-hand experience of what it\u2019s like to have cancer and to have a time-bomb ticking over your head.\u201d She tried to switch insurance to VHI, which initially said it would fund the treatment but at the last moment told her it would apply a two-year wait period for eligibility because the treatment was considered an upgrade in cover. Staff apologised for the initial misinformation and suggested she might have a case with the insurance Ombudsman but she felt too stressed to take this on at a time when her disease is progressing. All this tardiness while people\u2019s lives are hanging by a thread \u2014 Anita O\u2019Connell For now, her hopes rest on a decision by the HSE to reimburse the drug, which would trigger coverage by Irish Life and its availability in the public system. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, Ireland (NCPE) ran the rule over the cost-effectiveness of Trodelvy last March, and found it costs at least \u20ac82,000 per patient for a six-month course. Its review concluded that the drug could be considered for reimbursement \u201cif cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments\u201d. This means the drug will be approved if HSE and Gilead can reach agreement on a reduced price. So far this has not happened. Ireland is not the only country wrestling with these issues: the UK initially rejected Trodelvy then did a U-turn, while Dutch regulators are holding out for a 75 per cent reduction on the price quoted by the manufacturer. \u201cYou wonder what all the red tape is for,\u201d says Anita. \u201cAll this tardiness while people\u2019s lives are hanging by a thread. This drug could change my life, and many others. \u201cI felt they didn\u2019t try hard enough to help me. \u2018Irish Life \u2013 we\u2019re here to help.\u2019 Well, they weren\u2019t really there to help at all, to be quite honest with you.\u201d Responding to queries from The Irish Times, Irish Life says it funds treatments that have been approved by the NCPE, the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) or the Health Service Executive. The company last week announced an increase in premiums, for the second time this year. Laya says it \u201caccepts the guidance and direction\u201d of the NCCP, the NCPE and the HSE, \u201cin consultation with medical consultants involved in the treatment of patients\u201d. \u201cThere are times when we will approve drugs earlier than HSE-led approvals, where the treatments have been approved by the EMA and are supported by medical evidence.\u201d Acknowledging the frustration experienced by cancer patients, a spokeswoman says the company is \u201cworking hard to find ways to influence the speed at which funding decisions are made while upholding the clinical standards and regulatory guidance to ensure maximum patient safety\u201d. VHI says it is committed to ensuring members can avail of the best medically appropriate benefits \u201cin a timely manner\u201d. \u201cWe will provide benefit for drugs in accordance with our membership rules and when it is medically necessary for these to be administered in a hospital setting.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Profits at State-owned health insurer VHI grew 17 per cent to almost \u20ac53 million last year as claims tumbled in the face of Covid-19\u2019s impact on hospitals. VHI said on Wednesday that growth in the number of customers it recruited last year helped to boost sales to \u20ac1.5 billion from \u20ac1.4 billion in 2019. Its after-tax net surplus grew 16.9 per cent in 2020 to \u20ac52.7 million from \u20ac45.1 million the previous year, the State company\u2019s accounts show. VHI paid out \u20ac1.147 billion in claims on its policies last year, 17 per cent less than the \u20ac1.387 million claimed by customers in 2019. Public hospitals prioritised Covid-19 sufferers last year, while the State took over private facilities for a period to aid its efforts to combat the virus, leaving less scope to treat insured patients. Consequently the health insurer faced fewer claims on its policies. VHI returned \u20ac265 million to customers in premium waivers through 2020. VHI recruited 3,900 more customers last year, bringing total private health insurance membership to 1,131,900. Free reserves, held to ensure it could meet potential claims on its policies, grew to \u20ac773 million from \u20ac701 million, the company said. John O\u2019Dwyer, VHI chief executive, described the performance as solid, with increases in sales and customer numbers. Uncertainty \u201cWhile there is much uncertainty about the short-, medium- and long-term impact of Covid-19 on the healthcare sector generally there are a number of positives that can be drawn from the experience of the past year,\u201d he added. Mr O\u2019Dwyer predicted that changes such as telephone and remote consultations with doctors, introduced to counter Covid restrictions, could remain a part of healthcare in the future. The company switched its Swiftcare clinics, for patients with minor injuries and illnesses, from walk-in to appointment only, based on an initial phone call to establish customers\u2019 likely needs. VHI blamed Covid-19 travel bans for a fall in sales of services other than health cover. Income from insurance slipped to \u20ac28.6 million in 2020 from \u20ac34.5 million in 2019. The State company said this was mainly due to a fall in demand for travel cover that resulted from restrictions. VHI extended cover for those with multi-trip insurance at no cost, while it waived premiums for dental customers. The State-owned health insurer said that it responded to the Covid crisis in a rapid, measured and effective way last year.",

            "raw_text": "Max Homa emerged from a tie for fourth to win the Farmers Insurance Open by two strokes on Saturday in San Diego, his sixth career PGA Tour victory. Homa fired a six-under-par 66 on the South Course at Torrey Pines to finish at 13-under 275. Keegan Bradley also closed with a 66 to wind up as runner-up at 277 after beginning the day in ninth. Collin Morikawa took third place at 10-under after a 69. Third-round leader Sam Ryder carded a 75 on Saturday to drop into a tie for fourth at nine-under with Sahith Theegala and South Korea\u2019s Sungjae Im, who both shot 70 in the fourth round. Spain\u2019s Jon Rahm, who earned victories in each of his past two starts on the PGA Tour and four of his past six worldwide, started Saturday two strokes behind Ryder, but he, too, tailed off. A final-round 74 left him at eight-under, tied for seventh place with Australia\u2019s Jason Day, who closed with a 68. Tony Finau (fourth-round 73) and Japan\u2019s Hideki Matsuyama (69) shared ninth place at seven-under. Homa made four birdies on the front nine and was five-under for the day before carding his lone bogey on the par-four 14th hole. He closed par-birdie-par-birdie for his second win of the 2022-23 campaign, following the season-opening Fortinet Championship at Napa, California, in September. \u201cIt\u2019s a ton of patience and a lot of confidence,\u201d Homa said of his ability to come from behind. \u201cObviously there\u2019s a ton of great players. That board was stacked. But I just had to know that it\u2019s obviously a hard golf course, I just have to keep hitting good shots and keep hitting good putts. \"Winning takes a lot of luck, but it just takes, I think, a lot of patience and knowing that, especially on these final rounds, 18 holes is a marathon and a lot of stuff goes on.\" Bradley completed a bogey-free round with four birdies on the back nine, but it wasn't enough to catch Homa. \u201cWhen I chipped in on 13, I was trying to not look at leaderboards because I figured I was too far back to really push,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t push on this course, so I didn\u2019t want to feel like I had to push. Then when I chipped in there and I hit it to a couple feet on 14, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m ahead of these guys [physically on the golf course], I can post something and who knows.\u2019\u201d Rahm started his round with a thud, bogeying the par-four first hole, following with three pars and then making double bogey at the par-four fifth hole, where he drove into a fairway bunker and then played his next two shots out of the rough. He followed immediately with a birdie and then a bogey, and he finished with two birdies and a bogey the rest of the way.

            "raw_text": "It should be the first thing to pack.  Many Irish people don\u2019t bother with travel insurance \u2014 particularly for short trips and European breaks. But if you cancel a holiday or cut it short or need an air-ambulance, it can be the difference between financial security and financial misery. An annual policy, which costs not much more than \u20ac100 for a family, can save you tens of thousands of euro and endless heartache. A serious heart attack in the US will easily cost \u20ac200,000, while a hip replacement in a private UK hospital will cost \u20ac30,000. Even minor surgery done privately in many EU countries is \u20ac20,000. Don\u2019t rely on your health insurance.  It should cover treatments overseas but has limits. If a trip gets cancelled or your bags are stolen or you are the victim of a crime, you will get nothing back from your health insurance company. Timing is everything.  When it comes to travel insurance, it matters when you take out a policy. Many people think they\u2019re as well off holding off until just before a trip. But close to 40 per cent of claims are made before travel with illness and death the most likely reasons for cancelled holidays. And without wanting to be too gloomy, bad things can happen at any point in the lead up to a trip. You get what you pay for.  If you\u2019re planning to take two or more trips annually, get a multi-trip policy, and look at top end ones rather than the cheap as chips options as the difference in cover between an annual policy that costs \u20ac80 and one that costs \u20ac130 can be quite striking. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Always check what is covered.  Some cheaper policies do not cover travel rearrangement expenses, accommodation and cancellations relating to \u201cnatural disasters\u201d outside of weather disruption. If you want travel disruption cover, you will have to pay more for it, although such an add-on might only cost \u20ac15. Know what you need to do.  If you are making a claim, you need to inform the insurer as soon as you realise you can\u2019t go on the trip or need to cut it short. And always tell the police and get a report if you are the victim of a crime overseas. If you don\u2019t you will not be entertained by an insurer. And make any official complaint quickly. If you leave a police report for longer than 24 hours, insurance companies might view your claim with scepticism. Look at the exclusions.  You\u2019d be surprised how many things are not covered. In terms and conditions that can run to 30,000 words, there are many get-out clauses for companies. Pay attention to them. You don\u2019t have to read the full T & , but a handy tip is to paste them into a word document and do a word search for things like \u201cexcluded\u201d, \u201cnot covered\u201d and other variations.

Specifically he wondered what he was paying for. \u201cWe have health insurance and pay over \u20ac3,500 per year for the family (two adults and two kids) however we never seen any benefits from having it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only reason we got it was from fear factor, the \u201cwhat if we didn\u2019t have it and something goes wrong\u201d combined with me turning 35 and the additional costs they would put on me for never having insurance before!\u201d Fast forward to now, when Wesley is 38 and has \u201cnever used or seen the benefit of having health insurance yet I continue to pay for it because of the fear of the great \u201cwhat if\u201d! We still pay for the doctors and A&E visits and touch wood we haven\u2019t had to spend any time in hospitals yet!\u201d He says members of his family did have to go to A&E about three times in the three years \u201cand as far as we could see they get us to sign the form to make sure they get extra money from the insurance, but thankfully all trips to the A&E were sorted out on the day and we know we would have gotten the same treatment whether we signed the insurance form or not!\u201d He concludes by saying that he does not \"believe in insurance, but can see why they are in place. If I lived in America I would definitely see why having it is necessary but here in Ireland it's a joke \u2013 sure Kilkenny (our local hospital) doesn't even have any private beds and by the hospital's own admission to us on a recent A&E visit they said they couldn't give us anything different than a medical card holder or non insured person seeking care ... same beds same doctors same care! So from 18-35 I managed to save \u20ac3,500 per year now I'm just giving it to the company for the of mind.\" Wesley makes some good points in asking do we actually need health insurance? If you are unfortunate enough to have a heart attack or stroke, are involved in a car accident or have to be rushed into an emergency department suffering from some other ailment then health insurance is of little use. You will be taken to the nearest public hospital and treated in the public system at no \u2013 or at least at very little \u2013 cost. The public system can be excellent in this country and that is largely down to the medical professionals who run it, but it is a long way from perfect. Even with health insurance people can find themselves stuck on trollies for days even if they have been paying through the nose for insurance. However, the reality is that people with health insurance get access to consultants more quickly \u2013 even consultants working out of public hospitals if they are allowed see patients privately. They also get private and semi-private rooms in public hospitals and can avail of treatment in private hospitals, which significantly reduces waiting times for many procedures \u2013 both elective and otherwise. We all know patients in the public system can be left waiting months, if not years, before they get to see consultants and people have died as a result of those delays. That is why many people believe health insurance is essential. Another reason many view it as essential was contained in a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute which found that wealthier people with private health insurance are more likely to avail of potentially life-saving cancer screening tests in Ireland. The think-tank study looked at the uptake of breast and prostate cancer testing among middle-aged and older people and said people with neither private health insurance nor a medical card were \u201csignificantly less likely to have received a mammogram or prostate screening\u201d than those with just a medical card.",

            "raw_text": "The cost of health insurance for more than two million people is expected to increase within weeks as an era of price stability across the private healthcare sector comes to an end and the impact of the cost of living crisis is passed on to consumers. Earlier this month Irish Life imposed an average price increase of 5 per cent on customers and while the VHI and Laya Healthcare refused to be drawn on their plans when contacted by The Irish Times, a leading industry figure has told people to expect both to follow suit ahead of the spring. Increases similar to those rolled out by Irish Life would see the average annual cost of health insurance for a family of four on a standard policy rising by close to \u20ac200 a year. A couple on one of the top tier legacy policies on the market could end up paying substantially more than that. Insurance broker Dermot Goode said insurers were noting more claims being made as people seek to claw back money spent in an era of climbing prices and that healthcare providers have not been immune to the higher input costs endured elsewhere. \u201cElectricity, gas, equipment, prescription drugs, everything is going through the roof... all the hospitals are telling us that their costs of running their business have literally increased by multiples and that feeds into their negotiations with the insurance companies on increases,\u201d said Mr Goode of  totalhealthcover.ie , part of the Lockton insurance group. Similar increases Pointing to the Irish Life increase, Mr Goode said the sector was anticipating that the VHI and Laya would \u201cincrease their rates by a similar percentage by March 1st. And if we could get away with 5 per cent in terms of cumulative increase for this year that\u2019d be a bonus but we are... into rising costs right across the board for health insurance\u201d. The impact of the increases could, however, be significantly lessened and in many cases cancelled out completely for those who shop around, the head of the watchdog governing the sector has said. [\u00a0 These simple steps could help you save up to \u20ac1,000 a year on your health insurance \u00a0] Laura Brien, chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority, said more than one million people including individuals, couples and families are missing out on savings worth hundreds and sometimes thousands each year and often end up paying more for less cover by not actively seeking out the best value. She said that for people who have been on the same plan for more than three years \u201cthere\u2019s a very, very high probability that there\u2019s a better plan out there that has a comparable set of benefits.\u201d She also pointed to savings on the table and said the authority\u2019s research has shown that there can be price differentials of as much as \u20ac1,000 per person between two plans that fall within a broadly similar ranger of cover. \u201cThere are certain plans that have been out there for a very, very long time where the price has gone up every year and similar plans have been introduced more recently, with very comparable levels of benefits but at much lower rates.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "A near-\u20ac1.5 million insurance payout for business interruption during lockdown helped Kylemore Abbey and Gardens in Connemara, one of the country's top visitor attractions, cushion the blow of a near three-quarters decline in its revenues last year as the pandemic heaped pressure on the tourism sector. Visitor numbers at Kylemore, which is also home to a community of Benedictine nuns, fell to 100,000 in 2020 from close to 530,000 in 2019, when it was ranked in the top 10 in terms of numbers. However, it bounced back in 2021 by more than trebling the number of Irish visitors as domestic tourism grew, according to its executive director, Conor Coyne. Kylemore is also targeting a surge in British visitors after it features in a primetime BBC series that will be broadcast over Christmas. Accounts provided to The Irish Times show commercial revenues from the abbey, gardens, shop and restaurant plunged from about \u20ac7.4 million to \u20ac1.6 million. Entry fees to the abbey and six-acre walled gardens dropped from more than \u20ac3 million to \u20ac630,000, while shop and restaurant sales fell from about \u20ac4.3 million to below \u20ac1 million. Payroll costs Including other income from grants and donations, the trust that owns the abbey saw its total income fall to \u20ac3.6 million, including the insurance payout from Allianz. After the State covered about 40 per cent of payroll costs with pandemic subsidies, the operating company for the commercial business recorded a loss of less than \u20ac8,000. \u201cThere were obviously negotiations had, but Allianz was very supportive of us,\u201d said Mr Coyne. He revealed, however, that Kylemore has had to stall the building of a new monastery on the estate, which was to have been the first built in Ireland in 400 years. It decided not to risk drawing down bank debt for the project, which will cost well over \u20ac5 million. Construction work had already started and may not be resumed until the tourism industry recovers, said Mr Coyne. \u201cWe had already laid the foundations and built the blocks up to shoulder height,\u201d he said. The community of nuns who would occupy it, and whose predecessors moved to Kylemore 100 years ago from Ypres in postwar Belgium, currently live across three properties on the picturesque estate. Despite the pandemic and \u201cthe most challenging year ever\u201d, Mr Coyne remains bullish about Kylemore\u2019s future. Visitor demographics Before Covid, just 10 per cent of its visitors were Irish, with 30 per cent from the US and only 5 per cent from the UK \u2013 the rest came from Europe. Irish visitor numbers were up 250 per cent in 2021, he said. Average spend per head also rose as 2021 visitor numbers climbed to about 160,000. \u201cThe greater interaction with Irish visitors is the silver lining of the pandemic,\u201d said Mr Coyne. Some of the nuns, who are represented on the board of trustees, work in Kylemore\u2019s chocolate kitchen and soapery, while also following a life of study and prayer on the estate. Kylemore will be one of three monasteries featured in December in a three-part BBC programme examining life in religious orders. The estate, which is also home to a teaching centre for Indiana-based Notre Dame University, is investing heavily in environmental projects and links with local artisan producers, Mr Coyne says.",

            "raw_text": "As new research shows  Dublin households are facing the highest electricity costs in the European Union , what other cost pressures are consumers facing when it comes to groceries, car insurance and rent? Groceries The cost of bread and other foods like rice, pasta, pizza and breakfast cereals has increased by 8 per cent in the 12 months up to this July, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) consumer price index. The price of meat increased by 6.7 per cent in the last year to July, with the cost of eggs, cheese and milk up 8.6 per cent in the same period. Meanwhile, the cost of vegetables, as well as sugar and chocolate products, increased by 11 per cent, according to the CSO index. Scope for budget tax cuts and cash for households  is limited - this will be a difficult pre-election package to agree on  Scope for budget tax cuts and cash for households is limited - this will be a difficult pre-election package to agree on Similarly, more recent research by analysts Kantar put the increase in the cost of groceries in Irish supermarkets at just under 13 per cent, in the year up to the start of August. The most recent comparison of inflation across the European Union said the rate of inflation in Ireland was at an estimated 4.6 per cent in the 12 months to July. Ireland had the ninth lowest level of inflation out of the 27 EU countries, according to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which draws pricing comparisons across the EU. Rent The national average asking price for household rents between April and June this year was 10 per cent higher than the same period in 2022, according to quarterly data from property website Daft.ie published earlier this month. The figures, which are drawn from rental property asking prices on its website, noted the rate of increase in rent for new tenancies had slowed to 0.3 per cent in Dublin, but was up 4.3 per cent outside of the capital. There were fewer than 1,200 properties advertised for rent on daft.ie during the second quarter of 2023, with the average asking price for rent at \u20ac1,792. Car insurance When it comes to car insurance, figures published earlier this year show there had been a five per cent drop in average premiums in the first half of last year, compared to prices for 2021. The data from the Central Bank shows average premiums hit a high point in recent years of \u20ac710 at the end of 2017, falling to a low of \u20ac575 in the first quarter of last year. The figures were released in the financial regulator\u2019s midyear report from the National Claims Information Database. Electricity Household electricity costs in Dublin are the highest in the EU, according to new research commissioned by the Austrian and Hungarian energy regulators. Figures in the Household Energy Price Index report suggest Irish households may be paying on average more than \u20ac800 more for electricity than their EU counterparts. While wholesale electricity prices have dropped significantly in recent months, suppliers have yet to pass on significant reductions in household bills.",

            "author": "Colm Keena",
            "date": "2021-04-19",
            "raw_text": "The former president of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly, has expressed scepticism as to whether reduced personal injury awards will lead to lower insurance premiums. Asked about the issue, he said that when he was starting out as a barrister in the 1970s, insurance premiums were a \u201chot topic\u201d, and the insurance industry was saying that if juries were abolished in High Court personal injury cases premiums would come down. \u201cSo juries were abolished, but I didn\u2019t notice my insurance premium coming down,\u201d he said in an interview with The Irish Times. After that the industry said that if more cases were settled outside court, premiums would come down. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established, but again, he said, he did not recall his insurance premium coming down. \u201cSo, one wonders, one wonders.\u201d Mr Justice Kelly, who retired in June of last year, made the comments while discussing the publication later this month of the second edition of Damages, a key legal reference book covering the range of areas where damages are awarded. It was first published in 2015. He said that increased pressure on the District Court was likely as a result of the new judicial guidelines on personal injury awards, and that special measures or extra judges might be required as a result. The recent adoption by the Judicial Council of guidelines on personal injury awards is expected to see more cases being heard in lower courts that heretofore because of rules that direct lower award cases towards lower courts. The guidelines set out reduced awards, especially for minor and medium-range injuries. \u201cSo I think it will move cases downwards certainly, which will probably give rise to a fairly substantial increase [in cases] in the District Court,\u201d Mr Justice Kelly said. A lot of litigation has been delayed, in this and other jurisdictions, because of the pandemic, and it is likely \u201csome sort of special arrangements will have to be made\u201d to deal with the increased caseload. Submissions The new guidelines were adopted by the council on March 6th last after confidential submissions had been swapped among the judiciary, with some of them arguing against aspects of the proposed new regime. Minutes of meetings of the council\u2019s board, which have been seen by The Irish Times, also show that not all of its members backed the new guidelines. The council comprises all of the State\u2019s 168 judges, while its 11-member board comprises Chief Justice Frank Clarke, of the Supreme Court, as well as the presidents of the other four jurisdictional courts \u2013 the Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and District Court \u2013 and six other judges. The \u201cmajority board view\u201d was to recommend the adoption of the guidelines to the council, but it was recognised \u201cthat there are legitimate differences of opinion\u201d, according to the board minutes from February, which were released under the Freedom of Information Act. It was also agreed that a document would be issued to the judiciary \u201crepresenting the majority board view dealing with the submissions received and supporting the adoption of the guidelines\u201d, according to the minutes. The document that was to be issued as a majority board view was to be based on one produced by the President of the High Court, Ms Justice Mary Irvine, in response to a submission from Mr Justice Bernard Barton, according to the minutes. At the virtual meeting on March 6th, a majority of council members \u2013 146 of 168 \u2013 participated, with 83 voting in favour of the guidelines, and 63 voting against. At his retirement event three days later Mr Justice Barton expressed scepticism that the benefits of reduced award levels agreed in the new guidelines would be passed on to consumers by the insurance industry. Building a case He wondered whether the industry was \u201cbuilding a case\u201d against passing on award reductions, and said judges should not do anything perceived as \u201cbending to the will\u201d of the Executive because that undermined the independence of the judiciary. The new judicial guidelines are to come into effect from next Saturday, April 24th. Minister of State with responsibility for insurance Sean Fleming said the insurance companies had indicated they would begin to reduce premiums in response.",

            "raw_text": "The release of the Central Bank\u2019s second annual data dump on the public liability (PL), employers\u2019 liability (EL) and commercial property insurance on Wednesday underscores a few uncomfortable truths. Even though manufacturing and construction companies have, on average, seen premiums jump 68 per cent between 2009 and 2020, while costs have doubled for arts, entertainment and recreation sectors and jumped by a third for retailers and wholesalers, the three insurance lines \u2014 usually sold as a package deal \u2014 have been loss-making since 2015. It\u2019s an unsustainable business model in anyone\u2019s book. That\u2019s if general insurers weren\u2019t effectively relying on motorists to cross-subsidise their loss-making books. While insurers in the Republic posted a \u20ac128 million operating loss in 2020 on PL, EL and commercial property coverage, motor insurance turned in a profit of \u20ac163 million. Of course, the profits being generated by motor insurers since 2017 followed a period of heavy losses in the middle of the last decade, as personal injury costs spiralled and the industry proved that it was woefully unable to price risk properly. Why are stock markets so volatile right now? Central Statics Office (CSO) figures suggest motor coverage costs have come down by over 40 per cent since 2016, following a 70 per cent spike in the three years. But only a fraction of the 42 per cent slide in Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Piab) awards, since new judicial guidelines were brought in early last year, has been passed on to consumers. That\u2019s because there has been a spike in claimants rejecting Piab awards of late in favour of going the legal route. However, two High Court rulings this month dismissing challenges on the constitutionality of the guidelines should hopefully mean less litigation, which, as Central Bank data has consistently shown, generally results in much higher legal costs than Piab-settled cases and very little extra money for claimants. However, a real key to bringing down EL, PL and commercial property insurance costs lies in Minister for Justice Helen McEntee\u2019s plans to amend Irish law to balance a property owner or business\u2019s duty of care with personal responsibility of customers or members of the public. This can\u2019t come soon enough for insurers covering these three lines to return to making an acceptable profit and, hopefully, start cutting costs for customers.",

            "raw_text": "It may be with a touch of schadenfreude that many of us will take the news in the UK that owners of Range Rovers are having to pay higher insurance premiums. After all, one might think, if you can afford such a large, luxurious car then not only might you well enough expect to pay a higher premium, you can probably afford to do so, too. However, in the UK, the Range Rover, and its various models and versions \u2013 Sport, Velar, Evoque \u2013 have become such a target for car thieves that the situation has become untenable. With many Range Rover owners, especially those in London, reporting renewal premiums of \u00a325,000 (\u20ac29,000) or even more (yes, that\u2019s for one year\u2019s insurance cover) Land Rover itself was forced to step in. According to the UK\u2019s Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA) the Range Rover was the second-most stolen car last year, just behind the ever-popular Ford Fiesta. While many of those cars will have been stolen to order, and shipped whole to Africa, eastern Europe or beyond, many more will have been stolen and stripped for parts. The Range Rover brand appears to be especially affected, in part because its cars are considered so desirable anyway, but also because holdups in the production chain have seen Land Rover landed with a 150,000-order backlog, many of which are for Range Rovers. That skewing of the supply-demand balance, along with a shortage of spare parts for repair, has seen a dramatic growth in the theft of these cars. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 The thefts have seen Land Rover set up its own insurance arm, offering cover to those quoted outrageous figures for a premium or even refused a quote entirely. A Land Rover UK spokesperson said: \u201cCustomers of luxury cars and other luxury items are experiencing an increase in thefts due to organised criminal activity in the UK. The desirability of our luxury vehicles, coupled with concerns around thefts, has recently led to challenges in obtaining insurance cover for some clients. \u201cWe are fully committed to doing everything we can to address this by adopting a multifaceted approach: from our significant investment in vehicle security to now providing our own insurance. While our new insurance proposition is a key milestone, we want to reassure clients that we will continue monitoring and refining our service so that even more clients can take advantage of it.\u201d The company says its new insurance cover has provided quotes to more than 4,000 clients since October, with an average monthly premium of less than \u00a3200. Range Rovers are, of course, not the only targets in this widespread series of vehicle thefts. The rate of theft for Hyundai models, for example, has also spiked dramatically in the past year, while Lexus NX and RX models are popular targets for crooks. Has the problem migrated to Ireland? No, at least not yet. Melanie McCourt, marketing manager for Land Rover Ireland, said there had been no reports of a dramatic increase in Range Rover thefts here. \u201cWe are not aware of any of our customers having problems insuring their vehicles here in Ireland. As with any high-value vehicle, some insurers require a third-party tracking device to be fitted to the car. We do not offer manufacturer insurance in our market.\u201d Part of the problem is technology. Many, perhaps by now all of the high-end vehicles being targeted by thieves use keyless entry technology Equally a quick trawl of Irish insurers shows there have been no massive increases in cover for Range Rovers here. We took a notional two-year old Range Rover P440e PHEV model and received quotes for a (fictional) 50-year-old solicitor living in north Co Dublin, which seemed like a plausible Range Rover customer. The quotes, for fully-comprehensive cover, worked out at between \u20ac800 and \u20ac900 depending on the insurer. Expensive, to be certain, but hardly out of line with other makes and models. Would there be any issue, we wondered, for Range Rover owners from Ireland wanting to drive their cars to the UK for a holiday or a business trip, we wondered? Again, apparently not. Driving into the lion\u2019s den seems to be fine as far as Irish insurers are concerned. \u201cNo issues have been brought to our attention regarding Irish owners driving their cars in the UK,\u201d said McCourt. Nonetheless, there has been a rise in vehicle-related crime in the past two years in Ireland. While the final figures for 2023 are not yet available, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has warned: \u201cTheft of vehicles has increased significantly during 2022, with over 4,000 vehicles stolen, and it would seem 2023 would be continuing this trend to date. Theft of vehicles reported in 2022 show that 38 per cent of incidents occurred at residential locations.\u201d Part of the problem is technology. Many, perhaps by now all of the high-end vehicles being targeted by thieves use keyless entry technology, in which the car\u2019s key sends a short-ranged radio signal to the car, triggering the door locks as you approach. It\u2019s a convenient item, but it can be turned against you. Using equipment freely available online, crooks can amplify a key\u2019s signal so that it can reach from inside your house to the car outside, fooling and bypassing the vehicle\u2019s security systems. [\u00a0 Cost of car insurance claims jumps by 25% amid rising inflation and crash rates \u00a0] There are ways to counteract this \u2013 keeping your keys in a Faraday cage, in the form of a box or a pouch covered with a network of fine wires which block the signal, can help, but since such devices have become popular, the more determined crooks have apparently started to cut into the car\u2019s body panels to access and \u2018hot-wire\u2019 the car\u2019s electronics directly. The signals from tracking devices can also be jammed and disrupted. Again, this can be protected against with technological updates. According to Land Rover: \u201cAs part of a suite of services to enhance the ownership experience for its clients, JLR announced last month its Stg\u00a310 million investment in vehicle security to help tackle keyless thefts. This included an extensive roll-out of security updates benefiting more than 70,000 older vehicles in the UK since the initiative began in 2022, ensuring the same levels of protection against theft as current, new models. \u201cThis, along with dedicated collaboration with police and partners, is reducing thefts. The latest vehicles are proving highly resilient to thefts: UK police data shows that since January 2022, only nine of the 12,200 new Range Rovers on the road have been stolen \u2013 0.07 per cent \u2013 while only 13 of the 13,400 new Range Rover Sports on the road have been affected \u2013 0.1 per cent.\u201d These updates are all well and good, but as most military historians will tell you, in the battle between armour and warhead, the warhead usually eventually finds a way through. As is so often the case, then, the best defences are often the most simple. According to the Garda: \u201cA low-tech security device like a steering wheel lock, gates and a security barrier are very good deterrents to would-be car thieves. Always stick to the basics of car security first. Ensure your vehicle is parked in a well-lit or secure area, properly locked and all valuables are removed. Once in your home or office, ensure your car keys are as far away from doors and windows as possible, preferably shut inside a drawer.\u201d Still viewing all this with schadenfreude? Don\u2019t \u2013 while it might be tempting to sneer at those who can best afford it being penalised with higher insurance costs, those higher costs won\u2019t be solely targeted at one group. Rising vehicle crime will eventually affect us all, whether directly or through an across-the-board increase in insurance costs.

Otherwise, insurance companies will never cover or accept claims from homeowners and business owners who live and operate in areas where the risk of flooding is no longer an \u201cunforeseen\u201d event but an inevitability, Jonathan Hehir, chief executive of online brokers  insuremyhouse.ie  and  insuremyshop.ie  said. Dozens of property owners across the town of Midleton in east Cork  are facing thousands of euros in repair costs following widespread damage called by Storm Babet earlier this week. The vast majority of these have been unable to access insurance cover due to previous flooding in the area. \u201cThere is no way insurance companies will provide cover over the next couple of years to an area they know is going to flood,\u201d Mr Hehir said. \u201cThe only solution I can think of is to divert around three per cent of our property premiums into a fund that sits like a pool of money and is accessible to insurance companies for people affected by flooding who have insurance.\u201d Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Mr Hehir believes, based on a survey his business carried out after the 2015 floods in Midleton, that goodwill does exist among the general population to support those living in flood risk areas. \u201cI would 100 per cent contribute to a community fund for insurance premiums during flooding and I believe other people would too. That\u2019s the only way to convince insurance firms to pay out, at no cost to themselves.\u201d Paul Kavanagh, executive director of the Cork-based McCarthy Insurance Group, a broker with 17 nationwide offices, estimates repair costs in some business affected by the latest flooding could reach \u20ac500,000. He also warned that successful flood defence works in some parts of Cork have still not enabled people to acquire insurance cover for their homes and businesses. Insurance companies will not take the risk if there\u2019s any chance of human error in demountable defences, he said. \u201cThere needs to be Government push to support these communities. Five years ago there was that push and it looked like insurers would have to introduce a new system to insure people in these situations but there\u2019s no appetite to do that now.\u201d Chief executive of Insurance Ireland, Moyagh Murdock, admitted that in some areas where flood risks are \u201can inevitable event rather than a possible occurrence\u201d, insurance cover was \u201cno longer possible\u201d. \u201cInsurance is meant to cover events that are unforeseen or unlikely, not inevitable\u201d, he said. Mr Murdock said insurers operate in a \u201cregulated industry\u201d where they must \u201cact with prudent in order to ensure that cover is available and affordable\u201d. Ireland has an \u201cincredibly high level\u201d of insurance cover for flood and home policies \u2013 97 per cent, she said, although she acknowledged this would provide no comfort to those living in flood-risk areas. She said flood coverage levels were \u201cat their highest where fixed defences are in place\u201d rather than demountable defences, which leave room for human error. Asked what measures insurance companies were taking for the inevitable rise in flooding disasters as the worldwide climate crisis continues, Ms Murdock said many members had established climate-related units, creating \u201cbuild-back-better schemes\u201d and were \u201cpromoting greater awareness of climate mitigation techniques\u201d.",

            "raw_text": "The Central Bank\u2019s proposal to ban home and motor insurance companies from imposing so-called loyalty penalties on long-standing customers has been met by a mixed response from parties that will be lining up to have their say as the plan goes through a consultation process in the coming months. Sinn F\u00e9in's finance spokesman Pearse Doherty TD, who lodged a complaint with the Central Bank in late 2019 on the issue of differential pricing and brought a Bill on the matter to the D\u00e1il earlier this year, said that the regulator's move represents a \"victory for consumers\". \u201cWe now need to move to implement the proposals as soon as possible and to put a stop to the insurance industry and its dodgy practices,\u201d said Mr Doherty. \u201cUntil the changes come into effect next year, I would encourage consumers to shop around in order to get the best quote possible and not to simply accept the quote they are given on renewal of their existing policy.\u201d The regulator said on Wednesday that it is proposing to ban so-called price walking, where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurer. It estimates customers that stay with the same car insurer for nine years or more are paying 14 per cent more than a driver with a similar risk profile renewing for the first time. The difference on home insurance premiums averages 32 per cent, it said. Interested parties have until October 22nd to file submissions to the Central Bank on the plan. The regulator aims to have a new regime in place by July 1st next year. Cathie Shannon, director of general insurance at Brokers Ireland, which represents 1,225 broker firms, said that the body was disappointed the Central Bank stopped short of following the UK in effectively prohibiting providers offering below-cost discounts to lure new customers, or what is known as dual pricing. \u201cInsurance companies should never lose sight of the fair value they ought to be providing to consumers and the fact is that differential pricing damages the relationship of trust for which the industry ought to be known,\u201d she said. Prices and costs Consumer campaigner and  askaboutmoney.com founder Brendan Burgess also said the proposals do not go far enough. \"There is no good reason why insurance companies should be allowed to charge a lower price to new customers than they charge to existing customers,\" he said. \"Prices should reflect the costs. New customers are more expensive than existing customers as there are set up costs, such as commission.\" Insurance Ireland said that the proposals were \u201cbalanced and proportionate\u201d and that it will engage \u201cconstructively\u201d with the Central Bank during the consultation period. \"The report finds that differential pricing benefits some consumers who are engaged and shop around for their insurance to obtain the best price for their needs,\" said Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of the industry lobby group. \"However for other consumers who do not actively engage in shopping around, the practice can bring costs.\"",

            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2024-01-26",
            "raw_text": "We are in the middle of the peak holiday booking season with thousands of people planning and paying for their summer holidays. But while many will be happy \u2013 or at least willing \u2013 to spend thousands of euro on trips overseas, large numbers of them will baulk at the notion of paying not much more than \u20ac100 to give themselves the peace of mind of travel insurance. Travel heartache makes up a significant percentage of the queries and complaints sent to the  Pricewatch page  of this paper and far too often we hear stories of woe that could have been avoided had people taken out one fairly good value financial product in a timely fashion. Late last year,  two stories were carried on that page  which illustrates why travel insurance is good value for money. One reader bought flights for family members to Portugal but they were unable to travel as, weeks before the trip, one of the party fell and broke their hip. The reader was absolutely furious that the airline wouldn\u2019t countenance a refund despite being provided with a doctor\u2019s letter proving that the cancellation was for entirely legitimate reasons. Then there was the person whose ferry crossing from mainland Europe was cancelled because of bad weather. He was left with a substantial bill for making alternative arrangements to get home and thought it only fair that the company pick up at least some of the tab. In both cases, the readers thought they had a case and in both cases they were wrong. Airlines can look sympathetically on people who have to cancel in the event of sudden bereavement or very serious illness but they are not obliged to and will generally not even consider refunds if someone is unable to travel after a fall. And a ferry company is at the mercy of the weather \u2013 just as we all are \u2013 and is not obliged to cover the costs of alternative arrangements if they can\u2019t get a person home as planned. In both these instances, travel insurance would have helped greatly and it might have helped many more people last weekend when Storm Isha blew in and wrecked the travel plans of thousands of people coming to and from Ireland. An annual policy, which costs not much more than \u20ac100 for a family, can save you tens of thousands of euro and endless heartache if things go wrong. If you have the misfortune to have a heart attack in the US and are in hospital for just a week, you could easily find yourself with a bill of close to quarter of a million euro \u2013 sizeable enough to bring on another heart attack \u2013 while getting a new hip privately in the UK after a bad fall might set you back at least \u20ac30,000. Even minor surgery done privately in many EU countries is \u20ac20,000 while the cost of an air ambulance home can also be pretty eye watering. Despite its evident value, as many as half of all Irish people who travel overseas don\u2019t bother with travel insurance. The percentage of people who chose to go without cover climbs when it comes to short trips and European breaks. Many people think that because they have health insurance at home, they don\u2019t need travel insurance while they are away. There will also be those who chose not to take out travel insurance when travelling in Europe because they assume they will be okay on the basis that they will be treated in public hospitals in France, Spain, Italy or wherever, at no cost. If you fall ill while in the EU you will be treated in that country\u2019s health system just like you would be if you were a citizen of that country \u2013 although to be sure of that you will need a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). While such thoughts are understandable, they are mistaken. Private health insurance and an EHIC card might cover the cost of medical care overseas, but will do nothing for you if you have to cancel or curtail your trip, have your bags stolen or find yourself stuck for three days overseas because a storm has disrupted your plans for the home journey. As we said at the outset, many people are booking holidays now and, even among those who will take out travel insurance, far too many will hold off on paying for the policy on the basis that they can always take it out closer to the travel date when they might be just a little bit more flush. There is little or no advantage to waiting and delaying the purchase of travel insurance might well ending up costing people dear. As many as 40 per cent of claims are made before travel, with illness and death the most likely reasons for cancelled holidays. And at risk of stating the obvious and bringing you down \u2013 and who needs that at the end of the gloomiest month of the year \u2013 bad things can happen at any time. It is also worth bearing in mind that, with travel insurance, you do get what you pay for. If you buy the cheapest cover, you will give yourself some protection but the small print might exclude cover for travel rearrangement expenses, accommodation and cancellations relating to \u201cnatural disasters\u201d outside of weather disruption. There might only be \u20ac30 or \u20ac40 between the cost of two policies but they could be worlds apart when it comes to the cover they offer. If you want travel disruption cover, you will have to pay more for it, although such an add-on might only cost \u20ac15. Don\u2019t allow yourself be bedazzled by the top line prices or the promise of \u20ac10 million worth of medical cover. Pay attention to the small print: you might be surprised at how many things are not covered. For instance, phones are not covered in many cases, while other valuables can lose their cover if they are not in the presence of the insured at all times. And, if a person has not been storing a passport in a hotel safe when it is stolen, they can almost certainly forget about making a claim for its theft from the room. While we say pay attention to the terms and conditions, that does not mean you are expected to read them word by word. Such documents can frequently run to 30,000 words or more \u2013 and they are not the most interesting or well strung together words, generally speaking. But there will be get-out clauses for companies that you should look out for. One top tip is to do a word search for things like \u201cexcluded\u201d, \u201cnot covered\u201d and other variations. It gives you a sense of the cover you don\u2019t have that you think you do. When making a claim, you will need to follow the rules set out in the policy; any deviation from them could lead to your claim being rejected. It is key that you inform the insurer as soon as you realise you can\u2019t go on the trip or need to cut it short. And always tell the police and get a report if you are the victim of a crime overseas. If you don\u2019t you will not be entertained by an insurer. Make any official complaint quickly. If you leave a police report for longer than 24 hours, insurance companies might use the delay as a reason to avoid paying out. Because while travel insurance is enormously valuable to you, the big insurance companies did not get rich by giving money away. They all put obstacles in the way of making claims so it is key to dot all the is and cross all the ts to make sure that you get what you are due when you are due it.

            "raw_text": "All 23 reports into the administration of Quinn Insurance are to be made publicly available following an application from The Irish Times to the President of the High Court. The 2010 collapse of the company of bankrupt former billionaire Se\u00e1n Quinn cost the taxpayer some \u20ac1 billion, with surcharges on all motor and home insurance policies funding its losses. Quinn Insurance DAC was formally wound up earlier this week, 13 years after it was placed into administration. Reporting in recent days by Irish Times reporter Arthur Beesley revealed accountants from Grant Thornton and lawyers who worked on the administration and litigation linked to it received some \u20ac100 million in fees. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 While The Irish Times had the 23rd and final administrators\u2019 report to the court, it could not access the preceding 22 setting out detailed costs of the company\u2019s administration. When contacted by The Irish Times, Grant Thornton and its lawyers said they could not release the records, instead suggesting the documents \u201cshould be available\u201d by asking the court. The Courts Service said it does not keep possession of documents, such as these reports, that are submitted as exhibits. In an application to the court on Friday, The Irish Times, represented by Hayes solicitor Jeremy Erwin, submitted that the administrators\u2019 reports contained much information that was of public interest. The public interest in the collapse of Quinn Insurance relates to more than just professional fees paid out during the administration process, he said. High Court President Mr Justice David Barniville said there was \u201cno hesitation on the part of the court\u201d in providing the reports, subject to any redactions necessary for protecting privileged information. The reports are classed as exhibits, which are not retained by the court service alongside copies of affidavits and other core court documents, he said. The judge does not want the \u201cimpression to be given that I or the courts in general are impeding the provision of the reports\u201d. Unless there is any suggestion otherwise, these records \u201cshould be publicly available\u201d, he added. He asked lawyers for the joint administrators to update the court in one week about progress in reviewing the documents with the intention of making them publicly available. He said he hopes a set of reports, containing appropriate redactions, will be available by next Friday. Senior counsel Garvan Corkery, representing the joint administrators, said his clients will make every effort to have the reports ready by then. His clients have \u201cno objection in principle\u201d to the release of the reports arising out of the \u201clarge and complex\u201d administration. However, he said many of these documents were provided to the court on a confidential basis for reasons of commercial sensitivity. His clients needed a short period to review the reports in case there were commercially sensitive elements that need to be redacted, he said. The commercial sensitivity may have dissipated or disappeared entirely due to the passage of time, he added. \u201cI want to be clear that none of the confidentially touches in any way on fees paid to the administrators or their legal advisers,\u201d he said. \u201cMy clients have no interest whatsoever in withholding these reports,\u201d he added. Much of what is contained in the reports is already in the public domain, and any gaps will be \u201cfilled without delay\u201d, he said. The matter will return to court next Friday.",

            "raw_text": "UK-based insurance broker PIB Group has agreed to buy two insurance businesses from Dublin-based Melior Equity Partners, marking its ninth deal in the Irish market in less than two years as consolidation continues at pace in the industry. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed in a joint statement on Tuesday from both sides of the transaction. The businesses being sold comprise BHP Insurance, which specialises in coverage for not-for-profit organisations, and Keegan, Meredith & Williams Insurances. Both were bought last year by Melior, which is led by Jonathan Cosgrave and Peter Garvey, and put into a holding company called Damus Acquisitions Holdings. The two businesses employ 30 people. Following the completion of the deal, PIB will have 350 staff in Ireland. Post office quarrels / Drug dealing impacts city centre businesses PIB entered the Irish retail market in April last year with the purchase of Wexford-based broker Creane & Creane Insurance and quickly followed up with the purchase of Waterford-based Oliver Murphy Insurance. Its biggest Irish deal to date was the acquisition of Wexford-based Campion Insurance late last year for an estimated figure of more than \u20ac70 million. Jim Campion, chief executive of Campion Insurance, said the latest deal highlights the \u201cgrowing strength\u201d of PIB Group in Ireland as it \u201ccontinues the strategy of developing our specialist insurance offerings for the benefit of our customers\u201d. PIB and its Campion Insurance unit will continue to \u201cinvest significantly\u201d in deals next year in the Irish insurance market, the UK brokerage firm said. The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. PIB is backed by London-headquartered private equity firm Apax Fund and larger US peer Carlyle. The sale of BHP and Keegan, Meredith & Williams is the first exit by the so-called Melior Equity Partners II, a \u20ac160 million private equity fund closed earlier this year supported by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, the European Investment Fund, Bank of Ireland and AIB.",

            "raw_text": "There\u2019s an old adage that if you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing, and it\u2019s one that is apt for the insurance industry right now. On Monday, the Central Bank of Ireland published a report on private motor insurance that appeared to debunk a lot of the claims made by the industry about why premiums have been rising so steeply in recent years. Between 2013 and 2018, the cost of claims per policy increased by 14 per cent to \u20ac426 while the increase in premiums was 62 per cent to \u20ac706 (although industry group Insurance Ireland argues that this does not take account of provisions for future claims). Claims as a percentage of premiums fell from a high of 94 per cent in 2014 to a low of 59 per cent in 2017.The frequency of claims reduced by 40 per cent. The operating profit last year of the 20 insurance groups who provided data to the Central Bank was 9 per cent of their income. The UK equivalent was 5 per cent, so Irish insurers stand accused of milking consumers here. Insurance Ireland had a 570-word reaction statement prepped for publication to coincide with the release of the Central Bank\u2019s report. Among the five key points in Insurance Ireland\u2019s release was the line explaining that the \u201cIrish motor market was loss-making for several years\u201d, conveniently ignoring the healthy operating profits recorded in 2018. Nor will you find any acknowledgement that a large slice of those losses was down to them stupidly chasing market share by offering below-cost motor cover to consumers, notably between 2010 and 2013, and by not pricing risk correctly. Administration In the past decade, Quinn Insurance was placed into a costly administration process by the Central Bank, while RSA required a \u20ac500 million-plus injection of capital from its UK parent post-2013 when a large hole was found in its Irish balance sheet. As a consequence, RSA was fined \u20ac3.5 million by the Central Bank for various regulatory breaches. Malta-registered Setanta Insurance went into liquidation in 2014, leaving 75,000 motorists in Ireland high and dry without cover. Setanta had offered rates that were simply too good to be true. The European Commission started a formal investigation into whether Insurance Ireland has been operating a cartel In 2016, Gibraltar-registered Enterprise Insurance went into liquidation, leaving just shy of 50,000 policyholders here without cover. There was also no mention in Insurance Ireland\u2019s release about the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\u2019s investigation launched three years ago into whether motor insurers and brokers had engaged in anti-competitive practices by openly signalling premium price moves. As you'll see elsewhere on irishtimes.com, the CCPC told my colleague Joe Brennan that it was at at an \"advanced stage\" of its investigation. Last May, the European Commission started a formal investigation into whether Insurance Ireland has been operating a cartel by restricting access to a claims database. There was no mention of that in the release, either. For the record, Insurance Ireland denies restricting access to the database. There are many moving parts to the debate on motor insurance costs. The Central Bank report shows that just 16 per cent of claims were settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), half the level settled via litigation. And yet all personal injury claims must go through PIAB, an independent State body. Clearly, something isn\u2019t working here. Between 2015 and 2018, the average compensation paid to claimants taking their case through PIAB was \u20ac22,631, almost exactly half the level of award for those who pursued litigation through the courts. Marginally higher However, when you strip out the litigation cases where the the injuries are more severe and the awards are \u20ac100,000 or more, the average compensation paid is \u20ac23,199, only marginally higher than PIAB. The many high-profile failures in the Irish market raise questions about the oversight being applied The legal costs, however, are vastly different \u2013 an average of \u20ac753 in the case of PIAB (where cases take 2.5 years to complete) versus \u20ac14,684 when pursued through the courts (average timeframe 4.2 years). For roughly the same financial outcome, claimants have to wait longer for their settlement and the legal fees soar. The data suggests this is a lucrative line of work for lawyers. Regulators also have a case to answer. The many high-profile failures in the Irish market raise questions about the oversight being applied both here and in Malta and Gibraltar. Every motor insurance policy in the State will include a levy for many years to come to pay back the near \u20ac1 billion hole found at Quinn Insurance. The Central Bank\u2019s report this week is welcome in that it provides a greater level of transparency around motor claims. But there are still large gaps in the data, where a light needs to be shone before we get the full picture. If indeed we ever do. Meanwhile, if your insurer hits you with a premium increase in the coming weeks, in spite of you avoiding any claims or penalty points over the previous 12 months, don\u2019t just take their usual spin on a rising claims environment. Challenge them on the facts.",

            "author": "Wed Oct",
            "date": "2021-10-20",
            "raw_text": "Zurich Insurance is liable under a motor policy for a claim by a bin lorry worker for any damages awarded over an accident while he was loading a bin, the High Court has ruled. Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds said Zurich, rather than RSA Insurance Ireland must provide an indemnity for the claim arising after Joseph Moore, an employee of Urban and Rural Recycling of Wexford, suffered life changing injuries on December 19th, 2013. He had loaded a wheelie bin full of bottles on the truck\u2019s lifting equipment in Duncormick, Co Wexford, and while he was operating and controlling the lift, the bin became detached and fell near its emptying position, striking Mr Moore on the head. He brought a claim against his employer alleging among other things, negligence and failing to provide a safe system of work. A dispute arose over whether RSA, which provided employers\u2019 liability insurance for accidents at work, or Zurich, as insurers of the bin lorry, were liable should he succeed in his claim. The issue was referred to the High Court for determination. Zurich argued Mr Moore was the \u201cuser\u201d of the vehicle, and therefore road traffic legislation and European Directives, do not require the \u201cuser\u201d to be insured for injury to himself caused by the \u201cnegligent use of the vehicle\u201d by him. RSA and Urban Recycling argued Zurich was liable. Vehicle user Ms Justice Reynolds, in a judgment published on Wednesday, was satisfied that a \u201cuser\u201d of a vehicle under the Road Traffic Acts (requiring compulsory insurance for vehicles), when properly construed, covers the use of the vehicle that led to the injury. She was satisfied Mr Moore, although also the driver of the lorry, was not in charge of the vehicle for the purpose of driving.

            "raw_text": "Insurance brokers may bemoan that getting coverage capacity into the Irish insurance market has been an uphill struggle in recent years, as insurers struggle to make returns from employer and public liability and potential new entrants baulk at the general political and public noise around the industry. Charities, play centres, festivals and events and travel agents are among the dozens of sectors and subsectors struggling to get coverage or are down to one underwriter, according to the Alliance for Insurance Reform. But there\u2019s no shortage of foreign cash \u2013 specifically private equity money \u2013 chasing insurance brokers themselves. Last year saw the likes of Campion Insurance being acquired by private equity-backed UK brokerage group PIB for more than \u20ac70 million; Arachas, which is ultimately backed by US private equity companies Madison Dearborn and HPS Investment Partners, snap up Hooper Dolan for a figure believed to be north of \u20ac60 million; and private equity firm MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland's Innovo brokerage vehicle, set up in 2019, continue on the buyout trail. But as 2021 was coming to an end, some sector players concluded that activity would have to quieten down, as deals multiples had got to high levels of eight to 10 times\u2019 operating earnings, up from five to six times around the middle of the last decade. Snapped up That prediction has proven well wide of the mark. The past few months have, for example, seen UK broker Aston Lark, among the most active industry acquirers in the market in recent years, snap up its eighth Irish brokerage, PIB strike another deal and Dublin-based LHK Group mop up smaller Dublin peers. Last week, Kerry-based Gallivan Murphy Insurance Brokers agreed to be bought by a private equity-backed Assured Partners of the US, in a deal said to be worth more than \u20ac100 million. And, on Monday, New York-based brokerage NFP, also backed by Madison Dearborn and HPS, announced its third Irish deal in as many years, with the planned purchase of ReSure Corporate Brokers in Dublin. Even in downturns or a pandemic, businesses and households still have to renew their insurance policies. As such, private-equity firms see fees earned through insurance distribution almost as an annuity business, which allows them to load up deals with large levels of borrowings. Brokers say they more than justify their fees due to the volume of work that goes into researching the market for clients, preparing paperwork on contracts, and dealing with regulation and compliance. But if private equity is involved, someone\u2019s getting squeezed.",

            "raw_text": "Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has been told \"you need to get your hands dirty\" and be more directly involved with the insurance crisis to deal with the spiralling cost of premiums. Fianna F\u00e1il finance spokesman Michael McGrath said in the three years since Mr Donohoe became Minister he had had just one meeting with either the insurance industry or an insurance company. This was in March 2018 and was held to discuss US tax reform. The Cork South-Central TD said Minister of State Michael D\u2019Arcy who has special responsibility for insurance, had had \u201cdozens of meetings with individual companies and with Insurance Ireland\u201d, the representative body for the insurance sector. Mr McGrath acknowledged meetings were not the only measure of Mr Donohoe\u2019s involvement in the insurance issue \u201cbut you need to get your hands dirty and to get directly involved\u201d. Speaking during finance question time in the D\u00e1il, Mr McGrath stressed \u201cany attempt to resolve the insurance crisis will require the authority and power of the Minister for Finance\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in finance spokesman Pearse Doherty told Mr D'Arcy his intentions when dealing with the insurance sector were good, but \"you are not getting support at Government level\". He added: \u201cI know you dispute this suggestion but that is my view.\u201d However, Mr Donohoe said he had been directly involved in the completion of each of the reforms Mr D\u2019Arcy had introduced to change the claims and awards system and secure reductions in insurance premiums. This includes the passage of the Judicial Council Act which will establish a personal injuries guidelines committee of members of the Judiciary which will introduce new guidance for awards payments, once the Judicial Council is established. Mr Donohoe said: \u201cI have been involved in all of that because of the scale of the issue\u201d. He was \u201cabsolutely aware of the problems this issue is causing for businesses, those involved in leisure activities and those who depend on leisure activities\u201d. Mr D\u2019Arcy said the establishment of the new guidelines committee \u201cpretty soon\u201d would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Mr Doherty said, however, that the Government had not secured any commitment from the insurance industry as had happened 10 years ago when the industry gave a commitment to reduce premiums if certain reforms were introduced. \u201cThis involved a very clear table, a schedule produced at the time which said that premiums would reduce by a certain amount for each given reform.\u201d Mr Doherty claimed the Minister of State was \u201ctaking the industry\u2019s word at face value\u201d when it is \u201cripping off its customers. It is doing so through dual pricing, exaggerated costs, and misleading information it puts into the public domain.\u201d Mr Donohoe said key figures in the industry had given a commitment to respond when the judicial council committee\u2019s work was underway. \u201cThe Government and I intend to hold them to account in that respect.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "News last week that motor insurance premiums fell 5 per cent in the first half of last year is welcome, indicating that Judicial Council guidelines on awards for personal injuries, introduced in April 2021, have begun to bear fruit. It means, according to Central Bank data, that the average premium for motor cover has fallen 19 per cent from a peak in late 2017 to \u00a4575 by the middle of last year. But, counterintuitively and worryingly, the latest figures show that there was a decrease in the proportion of injury claims that settled directly with insurers, or by going through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) - and a rise in those resolved through the much more expensive route of litigation. Some 39 per cent of cases were settled through litigation in the first half of last year. That is up from an average of about 34 per cent over the previous seven years. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 And while the Judicial Guidelines are supposed to lower the attraction or incentive of going the legal route \u2013as there should be little upside for claimants in doing so \u2013 there was a much bigger drop in awards from the PIAB than in litigated cases in the first six months of last year. The average of all claims settled for less than \u20ac100,000 - which amounts to 94 per cent of all personal injury cases - fell by 24 per cent to \u20ac15,665 from 2021, but dipped by a little over 7 per cent, to \u20ac22,473, for litigated cases. Whether this is an anomaly remains to be seen, but if this trend were to continue, it must raise questions. Meanwhile, the sooner the Government signs off on a commencement order to allow the PIAB to offer mediation to resolve a claim \u2013 as allowed under laws enacted last year \u2013 the better. The same goes for duty of care reforms, included in a bill going through the Oireachtas at the moment, that are aimed at balancing a property owner or business\u2019s responsibilities with those of customers or the general public. This could help to reduce public liability premiums and thus reduce a threat hanging over many businesses.",

This deal follows on from Ardonagh entering the Dutch market last year through the purchase of L\u00e9ons Group for a figure believed to be around \u20ac50 million. Representatives for Ardonagh declined to comment on the value of both deals. \u201cThis is a hugely complementary acquisition, aligning neatly with our group\u2019s footprint both internationally and in the European market,\u201d said Mr Brennan. \u201cAlongside the vast expertise of L\u00e9ons, Klap further diversifies our portfolio and our customer base in the Netherlands, creating a strong platform to accelerate our growth ambitions in the region.

The company is also known to be scouting for deals in other European markets. The Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in Britain and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. Consolidation is less advanced in many European markets.",

            "title": "Pricewatch: Is the cost of your health insurance making you feel ill?",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2022-01-24",
            "raw_text": "If it\u2019s January, then it must be time to talk about health insurance. All told, more than a million people will see their policies renewed in January and February with many of them at risk of paying over the odds for reduced levels of cover unless they act quickly. It is important to stress at this early point that \u201cquickly\u201d is not the same as \u201crashly\u201d. Far from it. Unlike switching car or home insurance or moving from one electricity provider to another there is far more at stake when it comes to health insurance than the bottom line and making the right choices are more complicated than simply switching from company A to company B. But \u2013 as we say every year \u2013 with just a small amount of research and a little bit of knowledge, many people will be able to save themselves hundreds of euro and many more might be able to improve their level of cover without seeing their costs increase. Despite the savings on the table, hundreds of thousands of people will simply allow their policy to be renewed without asking too many questions of their provider. And once they miss their renewal window they will be locked into their policy for a full 12 months. Dermot Goode of Total Health Cover has been guiding people through the maze of health insurance for many years and he describes switching as \"emotive\". He also points to what he describes as the \"misguided loyalty\" many people have for their existing providers. Among the trends he identifies for the year ahead will be another round of price increases due to general medical inflation, with \u201cincreases of up to 5 per cent\u201d in rates across all insurers likely. Goode also notes that changes in the market mean many plans are disappearing and will be replaced by other \u201cperhaps not such good value\u201d plans. All told, 25 VHI plans have been \u201cretired, which means thousands of members will need to shop around for replacement cover\u201d, he says. But how can people know if they are paying over the odds? Goode has a simple checklist. A good rule of thumb is that better value can be found for anyone who is on the same plan for three or more years or those who have all the family on the same plan He suggests that adults who are paying more than \u20ac1,800 should not be doing so unless they have specific reasons for doing so. He also points out that many older members are on dated plans costing \u20ac2,500 per adult. And he reminds people \u201cin so far as is possible\u201d to make sure they are on an up-to-date corporate plan. As we have said on this page many, many times before, under Irish law all health insurance plans have to be made available to all comers. That means we can access corporate plans as individuals and don\u2019t have to go through our employers to do so. And what are corporate plans again? Well, they are usually marketed at large corporate clients and as an enticement to those companies, such policies often offer the best value for money. But it is worth noting that while insurers are legally obliged to make the plans available to everyone they are not legally obliged to tell us about them. That is why the plans they sell to the general public tend to have friendly-sounding if entirely meaningless names like \u201cWe Care About You Plus\u201d while the better-value corporate plans are often called things like \u201cPMI 125 Xdr289\u201d. Goode has more tips. He says a good rule of thumb is that better value can be found for anyone who is on the same plan for three or more years or those who have all the family on the same plan. \"The people who absolutely need advice are those on the old, dated plans. I am thinking of those VHI policies that were once called Plan B and Plan B Options, and are now called Health Plus and Health Plus Access or the Laya Health Manager or Essential Plus plans or an Irish Life Level 2 plan.\" He stresses that all of the above plans \u201care very good schemes\u201d but they are \u201cdated and overpriced\u201d. He notes that while the official stats suggest that the rate of switching is low \u2013 more than 60 per cent of the two million people have never switched, according to figures from the Health Insurance Authority \u2013 many people don't move from one company to another but do find better value with a different policy with their existing provider. \u201cI think the first thing a good health insurance advisor will do is try and find someone a better deal with their current provider for the very simple reason that it is less hassle for the consumer if we can do that,\u201d says Goode. I think there is something in the Irish psyche not to tell the insurers anything but, with a health insurance company, tell them everything He gives the example of a VHI customer living in Swords who might have the Swiftcare Clinic on their doorstep. If they change provider then they will lose access to the clinic, so the financial savings would have to be very significant for that switch to make sense. \"First and foremost we have to make sure the new provider gives you what you need,\" he says. He stresses that even those who renewed in recent weeks still have the option of finding better value because there is a 14-day cooling-off period for new contracts, so anyone whose policy was renewed within the last fortnight could still shop around today. Goode has advice on how people should approach their providers. \u201cI think there is something in the Irish psyche not to tell the insurers anything but, with a health insurance company, tell them everything. \u201cTell them the plan you have and every medical condition you have and every tablet you take and every doctor you see. They have to say whether it is covered or not. There is no discretion among them and they can\u2019t use your medical history against you. It is either covered or not covered.\u201d He also reminds people that there are no waiting periods for people who already have health insurance. \u201cYou get full credit for your previous membership, so if you have served all your waiting periods, they don\u2019t have to be re-served if you change. \u201cAll insurers must take you on irrespective of your age or medical history. If you are not paying any age loadings at present, then this won\u2019t change if you switch to another insurer and, as with car /home insurance, you can switch back to your previous insurer again next year if you\u2019re not happy with the new provider.\u201d Health cover: What\u2019s the best deal for me? Good value cover for around \u20ac1,000 per adult  VHI Enhanced Care 250: \u20ac1,024 per adult.  Irish Life Health (ILH) Benefit Access 300: \u20ac907 per adult.  Laya Signify: \u20ac989 per adult (includes 3 per cent credit charge).   Good semi-private corporate plans for around \u20ac1,400 per adult   These cover semi-private in private hospitals subject to a small excess per claim of up to \u20ac150 per claim. Limited cover for the high-tech hospitals is also included in these plans. They include 50 per cent refunds on eligible outpatient expenses with no excess to pay first.  VHI PMI 5310: \u20ac1,351 per adult.  Irish Life Health 4D Health 2: \u20ac1,394 per adult.  Laya Inspire Plus: \u20ac1,386 per adult (includes 3 per cent credit charge).   Good private room corporate plans at around \u20ac1,650 per adult   These are similar to the above plans except that they cover private accommodation in private hospitals, with limited cover in the high-tech hospitals. They include 50-75 per cent refunds on outpatient expenses with no excess to pay first.  VHI PMI 4810: \u20ac1,657 per adult.  Irish Life Health 4D Health 4: \u20ac1,680 per adult.  Laya Principle scheme: \u20ac1,656 per adult (includes 3 per cent credit charge) Insurance costs: How can I reduce them? Renewals  Shop around well in advance of your renewal. If you're not up to the task, have a trusted family member or friend help you as the savings could be \u20ac500-\u20ac1,000 depending on the plan held.   Advice  Don't rely on comparison websites as they are a useful guide only. If in doubt, seek independent advice and let someone else do the heavy lifting for you.   Switching  Don't be afraid to switch. It's just an insurance policy and if you ask the right questions and you're happy with the answers, switch and save. There is no reward for loyalty in health insurance.   Per person  Split your cover, ie consider the needs of each person on the policy and insure them on whatever plan matches those needs. You don't need to have everyone on the same plan or even insured with the same insurer.   Special offers  Check out those special offers such as free cover for children under 18 with one insurer.   Corporate schemes  Check out the corporate schemes as they include guaranteed refunds on eligible outpatient expenses which are not included on many dated schemes.   Phone  Still not sure you're on the right plan? Just phone your insurer and ask them if they have a lower-cost equivalent to your existing plan, ie similar benefits at a lower cost. You can put the same question to other insurers before you renew.   Excess  Don't be afraid to take on a small excess for private hospital claims \u2013 it's a great way to reduce your costs with minimum risk.   Cooling off  Don't forget about your 14-day cooling-off period after your renewal date during which you can amend or cancel your cover.   Topping up  If you're able to generate some savings, consider topping up your cover with a DeCare Dental plan or a cash plan from HSF health plan. For young people who can't afford full private health insurance cover, these schemes are definitely worth considering.",

            "author": "Denis Staunton",
            "date": "2024-04-26",
            "raw_text": "In a soundproofed room the size of a small concert hall stands a beige SUV surrounded by sensors and antennae, with cables snaking out of its doors. In this lab at Great Wall Motor (GWM) in Baoding, about 160km south of Beijing, they are running electromagnetic tests on their latest  electric vehicles  (EVs). The tests aim to ensure that the electromagnetic field the vehicle generates does not interfere with external equipment such as mobile phones, police communications or heart stents. It also seeks to protect the vehicle from external electromagnetic interference that could disrupt the smooth functioning of the car\u2019s entertainment and communications systems. GWM is among the Chinese carmakers that have emerged in the past couple of years as global players in the market for EVs \u2013 its Ora brand is sold in Ireland. Last year, 70 per cent of the company\u2019s sales were in  China  and 30 per cent were overseas, but they hope to increase the share of exports. \u201cIn the future [we] should be selling 40-50 per cent overseas but after a dip during Covid the domestic market is growing again,\u201d says Liu Huaxue, vice-president of operations management. \u201cIn Germany, Japan and Korea, their local markets are smaller so they sell more cars overseas than in their local markets. But China is a big enough market so basically we sell more cars here and fewer cars overseas. That\u2019s basically the logic.\u201d All GWM\u2019s vehicles are developed in Baoding and tested in the company\u2019s labs there, but they are sometimes adapted for conditions in overseas markets. Local conditions and surroundings and different consumer expectations require different responses. \u201cThe basic difference is in drivers\u2019 habits. In Germany, there is no speed limit on most motorways but in China we have a 120kph speed limit. So that\u2019s a basic difference. Mechanically, there\u2019s no real difference but we have to do some adaptive design changes to suit the local drivers\u2019 demand for high speed,\u201d Liu says. While sales of EVs have hit a rough patch in  Europe  and the  United States , they remain buoyant in China where four-in-10 new cars sold are either fully electric or hybrid. Some 1.8 million plug-in vehicles were sold in China during the first three months of 2024, a 38 per cent increase on the previous quarter. This year is expected to see the launch of more than 100 new plug-in models, with many of them unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show, which runs from April 25th to May 4th. This will bring the number of EV models on sale in China close to 500, 10-times the number available in the United States. With dozens of manufacturers competing in the Chinese EV market, prices are lower than elsewhere and they are falling further.  BYD , China\u2019s biggest manufacturer, has cut the cost of its Seagull model to RMB 69,800 (\u20ac9,008) and prices more generally have fallen by about one-third. EVs have been exempt from China\u2019s vehicle purchase tax since 2014 and the policy will continue until the end of 2025, after which the tax will be levied at half the level for fossil fuel vehicles. Liu believes that low running costs are another reason EVs are more popular in China than elsewhere. \u201cIn Europe, I think the battery charging cost is roughly the same as fuel, I think that\u2019s one reason. Here we have a lot of electricity from wind and whatever so it\u2019s relatively low in price,\u201d Liu says. \u201cThe EV cars are mainly used in the city areas. If you\u2019re going into the mountains you can buy a hybrid car or a fuel car. In the mountain areas we don\u2019t have enough charging stations. But if you mainly want to use the car in the city area, the EV car is a good option.\u201d The Chinese authorities not only subsidised EV manufacturers but they have also rolled out the world\u2019s largest network of charging stations. In 2015, China had 100,000 charging stations; in August 2023 there were more than seven million. Meanwhile, in Beijing, the running costs of an EV are about one-tenth of those of a fuel car. And charging may be about to get easier as Nio, one of the top Chinese manufacturers, has introduced a battery swap system. Drivers pull into a station that looks like a car wash and the battery is automatically removed and replaced from beneath the vehicle in a few minutes. Despite subsidies and tax breaks from state and provincial government and cheap loans from state banks, none of China\u2019s EV producers are hugely profitable and most are loss-making. But the sector has the backing of the  Chinese Communist Party  leadership and is also attracting new entrants from the technology sector. [\u00a0 Tumbling prices for new electric cars is not all good news \u00a0] Smartphone company  Xiaomi  launched an EV at the end of March and less than a month later, it has received more than 70,000 orders \u2013 close to its original target for a full year.  Huawei  has also moved into the EV market, launching seven models with established Chinese car manufacturers. Although sales of internal combustion engine cars declined by 10 per cent last year, neither the Chinese authorities nor the country\u2019s manufacturers are planning to eliminate fuel vehicles altogether. Liu says that GWM expects to continue to manufacture traditional vehicles while embracing innovations such as those in hydrogen energy technology. \u201cWe are a new company that covers all categories of traditional fuel vehicles, hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles and hydrogen energy. Our goal is not to simply pursue hybrids and pure electric vehicles,\u201d Liu says. \u201cWe believe that the future world may be one that is relatively balanced. Fuel will not simply disappear. It will continue alongside hybrid, electric and hydrogen.\u201d Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here",

            "raw_text": "UK holders of business interruption insurance have won a \u201csignificant\u201d victory in a high court test case to determine whether the coronavirus pandemic should trigger payouts under their policies. Lawyers acting for the financial conduct authority (FCA) , which brought the case on behalf of the policyholders, said the judges had found in favour of claimants \u201con the majority of the key issues\u201d. In particular, they ruled that payouts were triggered under certain \u201cnon-damage\u201d clauses that covered disease and denial of access to business premises. Paul Lewis, partner and global head of insurance disputes at the FCA\u2019s law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, said policyholders would need to read the 160-page judgment from Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Butcher very carefully to see how the principles laid down by the court applied to their particular policy wording. In all, the judgment considered 21 wordings, and reached different conclusions for each. However, he added: \u201cThis is a really significant judgment. It brings guidance to how business interruption insurance wordings should operate in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has had such a devastating effect on businesses across the country. The decision should bring welcome news to a significant number of policyholders.\u201d According to FCA estimates, the findings could effect as many as 370,000 policyholders one way or another - and successful claims could potentially run to tens of thousands of pounds. Immediately after the judgment, shares in insurance companies Hiscox and RSA, which were involved in the case, were down 6 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. But the insurers have the right to fast-track an appeal on the judgment straight to the supreme court. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020",

            "raw_text": "Agreement by the Judicial Council to new guidelines for personal injury awards is a vital step to lowering insurance costs to businesses, according to a new report from the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council (NCPC). If this approach does not reduce costs and increase certainty for business, then the Government needs to legislate to cap personal injury awards, it says. The Judicial Council, which includes the country\u2019s 166 judges, is considering whether to sign off on new guidelines proposed by a committee it established to consider the matter, amid indications that some judges have reservations. The proposed guidelines, to be considered by the council on March 6th, have not been published, but are expected to reduce judicial discretion and provide for a reduction in awards, particularly for more minor soft-tissue injuries. The report from the NCPC says it believes that this is the best approach to reduce awards, but that the outcome needs to be carefully monitored. If the necessary reduction in costs does not happen, the Government should legislate to cap awards, it says. It refers to a report on the issue by the Law Reform Commission, which said a legislative route could probably be found to cap awards, though warning that care would be needed to avoid a constitutional challenge. Businesses have complained about the rising cost of public and employers\u2019 liability insurance and have criticised the pace of reform plans. Injury awards are currently based on levels set in the so-called Book of Quantum, which the NCPC said had been shown to be well above comparable markets, notably the UK. The Judicial Council guidelines would replace the Book of Quantum, and the NCPC says it hopes it should reduce awards and lead to more certainty and clarity for business. The court route It also says that it should dissuade claimants from rejecting awards made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) in favour of legal action, as both processes would be covered by the same guidelines. If adopted by the council, the new guidelines would be due to take effect by the end of July. Business interests have expressed concern that the proposals may not go far enough to reduce the level of awards. As well as calling for the new guidelines, the NCPC \u2013 formerly known as the Competitiveness Council and now chaired by economist Dr Frances Ruane \u2013 identifies two other key recommendations. It says the Government needs to press ahead with reforms to the PIAB, with some fall-off in claimants using this route in recent years in favour of going to court. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently developing proposals to reform the role of PIAB, which will go out for public consultation. New measures are also needed to increase competition in the market, including establishing a Central Bank databank for potential new entrants and the independent management of industry claims information. Insurance reform was identified as an important issue in the programme for government, and the Government has established a new office to oversee the policy.",

            "author": "Fiona Reddan",
            "date": "2020-12-16",
            "raw_text": "What does a government do when it can\u2019t decide what to do on a thorny issue? Commission a report. And when it still isn\u2019t clear on what to do? Commission another report to discuss the findings of the original one. It\u2019s a tried and trusted approach, and one that we\u2019ve seen many times before. Now it\u2019s the turn of the insurance sector, and the Central Bank\u2019s examination into whether or not dual pricing is so detrimental to the interests of consumers that it should be banned. After all, since the Government pledged to remove the practice last June, we\u2019ve had an initial report from the Central Bank of Ireland that found that dual pricing across the home and car insurance sectors was more common than expected. Subsequently, a letter was issued from the regulator to the chief executives of the various insurers companies asking them to \u201cunderstand fully the impact of pricing practices\u201d on their customers. So far so benign.  Then came Monday's interim report.  A report so worthwhile that Davy stockbrokers managed to sum it up in a note to clients entitled: \"No new findings in interim report\". Perhaps the regulator is building up to its next report, scheduled for September 2021, with the Government indicating it will then take action, if necessary, by the end of 2021. All this begs the question, if dual pricing is so damaging, why isn\u2019t the Central Bank taking action now rather than waiting for another illuminating report, and another year? To do so would be \u201cprevious\u201d, Derville Rowland, director general of financial conduct at the Central Bank, told The Irish Times on Monday. Best, it would seem, to wait another year to do more research. Mince pie analogy Let\u2019s say it\u2019s coming up to Christmas and you head to your local supermarket, which you regularly frequent, for some mince pies. You ask how much they are and are surprised to be told they cost \u20ac5 for a box of four. But you accept the price and pay for them. Imagine your surprise then, when you meet your friend on the way out \u2013 who lives far away and never goes to that supermarket \u2013 with two boxes of said mince pies who gleefully tells you they only paid \u20ac5 for the eight pies. This is what dual pricing is about \u2013 charging two similar customers a different price for the same product. While it\u2019s easy enough to get worked up about being overcharged for mince pies, we have become inured when it\u2019s used on us by everyone from airlines to utility companies to insurers. And there is no doubt that it is detrimental to a certain cohort of consumers \u2013 typically those who are reluctant to switch in the case of insurance \u2013 which is why the Government and opposition parties want to see the practice banned. To be fair to the regulator, while Monday\u2019s report may not have offered any substantial new information, it did offer a further insight into the impact it can have on consumers. Waiting another year for another report is unlikely to change the outcome It found that customers who stay with an insurer are subsidising lower-cost premiums for \u201cnew business\u201d, and the longer a customer is with an insurer, the more they are likely to pay for their cover when compared with a new customer. Older people are particularly vulnerable to this loyalty premium, and are victims of \u201cprice walking\u201d, whereby insurers increase premiums incrementally each year for existing customers come renewal time. It\u2019s enough of an issue to understand why the Government vowed to ban the practice in its action plan for the insurance sector last week in order to protect consumers, and enough for Sinn F\u00e9in to press ahead with plans to publish a Bill this week to ban the practice in the Irish market. But not enough for the Central Bank to recommend taking action? Stifled competition Key to the Central Bank\u2019s hesitancy to act is its fear that doing so could damage competition. As noted in the report, some consumers will get a better price by switching as dual pricing can foster \u201ccompetition and innovation\u201d and lower prices for new business, while the regulator\u2019s director of consumer protection, Gr\u00e1inne McEvoy, previously expressed concern that banning it could stifle competition. But is competition really so great for consumers that it should trump regulators taking a firmer hand? Some years ago, we were told that banks couldn\u2019t be forced to bring mortgage rates down to European norms, because doing so would inhibit competition and discourage new entrants from the market. How has that worked out? Well, Irish mortgage rates are still far higher than on the continent, while our one new entrant \u2013 Avant Money \u2013 only offers its best rates to those with loan-to-value ratios of 60 per cent or less, making it a niche competitor. Moreover, for a country that has had such a dubious experience with competition in financial services \u2013 recall cut-throat competition in the run-up to the financial crisis as lenders aggressively chased market share resulting in the eventual near-collapse of the sector \u2013 it\u2019s sometimes surprising to hear competition being talked about in such revered tones, as has been the case with the Central Bank of late. Ultimately, a decision must be made. Dual pricing is either a problem, or it isn\u2019t. On the one hand, as the Central Bank has already discovered, it\u2019s unfair to people who are either unwilling or unable to switch. On the other, again as the regulator has found, it helps those who are willing to shop around to get lower prices. Banning it will affect the latter but help the former and vice versa. What it comes down to then, is who the regulator thinks will be impacted most egregiously. Waiting another year for another report is unlikely to change the outcome.",

Lockton Ireland, which has been active in the market since 1982 as a general insurance broker, hired senior New Ireland Assurance executives Ray McKenna and Niall O\u2019Callaghan last year to develop a strategy to get into the employee benefits space. The new division moved earlier this year to buy Total Health Cover, led by Dermot Goode and which works with employers and individuals to advise on health insurance plans and broader wellbeing supports, and take control of Independent Financial Advisory Trust, a Dublin-based financial broker with a focus on advising corporate pension clients. Lockton Ireland says that by the middle of 2023 it will have tripled its total Irish headcount by about 60 employees in the space of 18 months. The group is forecasting that its 2022 acquisitions will mean their Irish business revenues reach approximately \u20ac7 million for the financial year to April 2023.

The Irish pensions market is navigating new EU pension legislation (IORP II), which brings a new layer of corporate governance and regulatory requirements to the pensions market.

Carmel Ryan, of Oaklee, Model Farm Road, Cork, says she was never contacted by Zurich Life Assurance plc before it cancelled the policy a month-and-a-half after the \u20ac4,868 monthly premium was missed because of a temporary insufficiency of funds in the couple\u2019s bank account. Zurich now says it will only reinstate the policy if her husband Sean Ryan takes out a new policy. Ms Ryan says her husband is gravely ill and would not meet the underwriting criteria for such a reinstatement. She has sued Zurich, of Frascati Road, Blackrock, Dublin, and her brokers SYS Mortgages DAC, Quintins Way, Pearse Street, Nenagh, Co Tipperary. The case was admitted to the fast track Commercial Court on Monday by Mr Justice Denis McDonald on consent between the parties. In her action, Ms Ryan says monthly direct debit payments to Zurich have been made since May 1990 from an account which is used for very limited purposes, including the payment of premia. The monthly premium due on September 1, 2021, was not collected because, due to administrative oversight and inadvertence, there was \u201ca temporary insufficiency of funds in the account\u201d, she says in an affidavit. Payment The policy provides for a 30-day grace period in the event of a missed payment. Ms Ryan says Zurich maintains it wrote twice to her about the missed payments in September 2021, and again on the following October 18 cancelling the policy. She says she never received these letters. Zurich, she says, also claims it attempted to contact her broker but due to \u201csystem or administrative error\u201d on the part of one or both defendants, the information was not communicated to SYS Mortgages. Zurich refused to reinstate the policy, refuted liability in correspondence with her solicitor and she then brought proceedings. She says she has paid Zurich \u20ac568,643 in premia over the last 32 years and she anticipates it will be worth \u20ac1,064,798 on the death of her husband. She is seeking declarations and orders, including that the termination of the policy was in breach of contract and that the policy is valid and subsisting, as well as damages.",

            "raw_text": "The Supreme Court has ruled insolvent insurer Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL) must pay \u20ac5 million \u201cinterim security\u201d towards the legal costs of PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as the price of the court not placing a stay on QIL\u2019s action claiming some \u20ac800 million damages over PwC\u2019s auditing of the insurer. The Chief Justice, Mr Justice Frank Clarke, stressed the court would consider imposing a stay from January 1st, 2022 if the full sum of security, the amount of which has yet to be agreed or determined, is not paid by then. Any such stay was subject to whether the High Court considered QIL acted as speedily as possible to provide full security by that date and to any appeals, he said. PwC had argued a general stay on the proceedings should apply until the full security sum is paid. PwC and QIL previously agreed the legal costs of the High Court case, initiated in 2012 with a hearing date yet to be fixed, would be some \u20ac30 million, but that figure may have to be updated. The \u20ac5 million interim security is expected to be paid, subject to approval of the president of the High Court, out of the State's Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF). Administration When placed in administration in 2010, QIL had an underwriting business of \u20ac1 billion. Its losses were met by a 2 per cent levy on all non-life insurance policies in the State. QIL\u2019s primary business now is the prosecution of its claims against PwC over its alleged negligent auditing of the insurance underwriter between 2005 and 2008. PwC denies the claims. The Supreme Court earlier this year dismissed QIL\u2019s appeal over the security order. QIL had paid \u20ac500,000 security towards PwC\u2019s costs pending the hearing of its appeal. The main outstanding issue following the court\u2019s judgment concerned whether the High Court proceedings generally should be stayed until QIL provided whatever security for costs is ultimately agreed or determined. Giving the court\u2019s ruling, dated June 25th, Mr Justice Frank Clarke noted it is normal practice, when security for costs is ordered, to stay the proceedings generally until that full security, as determined by the High Court, is paid. QIL, recognising that practice, had urged no stay on condition it provide \u20ac5 million \u201cinterim security\u201d. No evidential basis PWC sought a stay on the proceedings generally, arguing there was no evidential basis for the suggestion \u20ac5 million might be sufficient to meet costs incurred by it pending the main hearing. The Chief Justice said the importance of the case means the imperative to ensure litigation is concluded within a reasonable timescale \u201capplies with force\u201d. Within the bounds of what is reasonable in a complex case, these proceedings should go to trial as quickly as possible, he said. Significant progress has been made on discovery issues but some issues remain, he noted. In the particular circumstances of this case, it was appropriate to adopt QIL\u2019s \u20ac5 million interim security proposal, to be paid within seven days, he ruled. The QIL \u20ac5 million estimate for work over the coming months was the only estimate put before the court and was \u201cnot clearly unreasonable\u201d. PwC had not advanced its own estimate which would have included information as to precisely what work is likely to be done in the forthcoming months, he said. He also set out proposals aimed at leading to a speedy resolution of the issue of the full amount of security to be put in place.",

Announcing the move on Friday, it described the business as \u201cone the most respected insurance brokers in Tipperary town\u201d. It did not disclose the value of the deal. The acquisition is the second investment in Tipperary by Arachas after it bought O\u2019Donoghue Hooper Dolan in 2020. Arachas provides businesses and consumers with motor and home insurance. It said the acquisition would increase the availability of those products to the people of Tipperary. \u201cTom Fogarty Insurance Brokers is a well-established and respected independent insurance brokerage for over 60 years operating from offices at Bank Place in Tipperary Town,\u201d said Arachas. \u201cThe business caters for the personal- and medium-sized business market specialising mainly in farm, home, shop, office and business insurance.\u201d Arachas chief executive Joey Wynne said the move strengthened the company\u2019s regional presence throughout Ireland. Speaking on behalf of Tom Fogarty Insurance, Michael Fogarty said: \u201cWe have had over 60 years servicing the people of Tipperary Town and wider area and I would like to thank both our staff and customers. \u201cOur staff will transfer directly to Arachas and it will be very much business as usual whereby our customers can continue to deal directly with the same staff and they will now have access to a much wider range of insurance products as well.\u201d Arachas, which is chaired by former minister for finance Charlie McCreevy, saw its net profit jump by 35 per cent in 2022 to \u20ac30.9 million, as deal-making across the industry continued at pace. The company paid out \u20ac77.7 million in dividends to holding companies within the wider corporate family, according to filings with the Companies Registration Office. Arachas, which has 18 offices around the Republic, has been active in the acquisitions market in recent years, including Dublin-based Stuart Insurances and Apex Insurance in Cork.

            "raw_text": "Close to 50 per cent of policy holders\u2019 plans are up for renewal during the next three months. In this chaotic year, as health circumstances and financial situations have changed for so many, it has never been more important to ensure your health insurance meets your needs. Price is a huge factor, and if you\u2019re ready to commit to 30 minutes to an hour of analysis, your efforts can pay dividends. Searching and seeking information can take up a huge amount of time, but with the  Health Insurance Authority's online comparison tool , weighing up your options becomes a lot easier. It allows you to compare the benefits and prices of all private health insurance plans available on the Irish health insurance market. As an impartial, government body that regulates the private health insurance market, you can also rest easy that you\u2019re not being upsold or influenced towards any particular provider. So, how easy is it to use? We asked an Irish Times reader, whose plan was up for renewal, to road test the comparison tool and let us know how she got on. Liz Doyle is an admin manager from Co Wicklow, and she takes on the responsibility for managing the family health insurance plans for her husband and their three young children. I found it very useful to narrow down the search \u201cI like the security of having private health insurance,\u201d she explains. \u201cI used to work in insurance, though mostly home, business and motor, and I have seen the pitfalls of not holding a good plan. Sometimes you\u2019re not covered for what you think you are, and you don\u2019t know until you claim.\u201d Liz points to one experience with her health insurance provider a few years ago whereby at the end of the year she got a significantly lower amount back than expected for everyday expenses, as she had misunderstood how the excess would apply. It\u2019s exactly the sort of thing the tool can help you to check and watch out for, allowing you to compare the features and benefits of multiple plans in the Irish market using simple visual selection metrics and side-by-side comparisons. You can pick your current plan and compare it with similar plans from other providers, seeing what benefits each offer. The tool delivers information that can help you decide whether you should stay with your current health insurance provider, or make a switch. Be your own broker Due to her background in insurance, she is familiar with the terminology and is the kind of person who reviews their plan each year \u2013 a rarity. \u201cThe language can be confusing, especially around limits and restrictions,\u201d she says. Liz has tried her best to switch frequently for the best part of the last decade. She has forgotten to change and stuck to the same plan out of forgetfulness \u00ad\u2013 and regretted it. \u201cI was paying over the odds and was planning to change. Things got very busy in December and I forgot about the auto renewal until the funds came out of my account. I had an irritating reminder then for a whole year.\u201d Start with the online tool This year, Liz has used the  HIA comparison tool  to help her. \"I found it very useful to narrow down the search. I then called insurers directly. It's about an hour's work at the start, but as you get used to the process and terminology, you understand more each year what to watch out for, and it gets quicker.\" Liz says the HIA online tool is a great starting point for comparison, \u201cIt gives you knowledge of what\u2019s important in your plan that you can discuss with insurers.\u201d She cites one feature of the tool as being particularly useful. \u201cIt shows less well-known plans, like company policies. Technically any consumer can sign up to a company policy, they just won\u2019t get the company discount if they don\u2019t work in the relevant place. But these plans can have lots of benefits included and are at good prices, even without the staff discount.\u201d [\u00a0 online health insurance comparison tool \u00a0] [\u00a0 info@hia.ie \u00a0] You will need three details to hand: your renewal date, plan name, and ages of consumers. The HIA get notifications 30 days in advance, so if your renewal is January 1st, you can call them from December 1st for the most up-to-date information.",

            "raw_text": "The personal injuries guidelines came into effect in April 2021 and replaced the Book of Quantum used by the courts in assessing damages in personal injury cases. The guidelines must, by law, be taken into account by the courts and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) when making awards, although there is scope to depart from them. The guidelines were intended to bring about a more uniform approach to the setting of awards \u2013 and a reduction in their size \u2013 and indirectly to lower insurance premiums. Their introduction in the midst of the pandemic shutdown meant that their initial impact was muted, particularly for injuries related to motor vehicle accidents. The Central Bank has now published data  on motor insurance claims for 2022, the first year since the guidelines that motor traffic was not dramatically reduced by measures to contain Covid-19. The results are a mixed bag, but there are some encouraging signs that the guidelines are having the desired effect. According to the Central Bank, half of all motor insurance injury claims were settled under the guidelines in 2022, up from 16 per cent in 2021.  Of the number settled within the guidelines, almost all were settled either directly with the insurer or via PIAB and involved awards that were between 32 and 47 per cent lower than comparable claims made under the Book of Quantum in 2021. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 The picture is less encouraging when it comes to the other half of claims: the cases that go to court. Only 6 per cent of cases that went to court were settled under the guidelines and as a result the impact of the guidelines cannot really be quantified. The court channel accounts for 77 per cent of awards by value but only 50 per cent of cases by number. It is not clear whether the implied higher payouts are down to courts not embracing the guidelines when agreeing settlements or the fact that more serious cases \u2013 involving more grievous injuries \u2013 tend to go to court. More work is clearly needed to answer the question but the relatively low use of the guidelines in courtrooms is a matter of concern.",

            "title": "Health insurance premiums could double if private care is removed from public hospitals, insurer warns",
            "author": "Ellen O'Regan",
            "date": "2023-06-23",
            "raw_text": "The Government has been warned that the removal of private healthcare from public hospitals could result in \u201can unavoidable and significant increase in the cost of holding private health insurance\u201d, with the possibility that some premiums could double. In a letter written by  Irish Life Health  to the Department of Health on April 13th, the insurer expressed concerns about the impact of plans to amend regulations for minimum health insurance benefits. Currently, health insurers must provide a minimum level of benefit in all contracts, including listed health services provided in both private and public hospitals. It is proposed that the regulations would be amended to remove the requirement to offer private care in public hospitals, in line with the Sl\u00e1intecare reform plan. He expressed concerns that a \u2018large cohort\u2019 of younger customers would likely give up holding private health insurance altogether rather than purchase more expensive plans Following a meeting between Department of Health secretary general Robert Watt and Irish Life Health managing director Gerard Davis in March, Mr Davis wrote to Mr Watt warning that this would greatly reduce the value of entry-level health insurance plans, which are popular with younger customers. In the letter obtained by The Irish Times through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, he expressed concerns that a \u201clarge cohort\u201d of younger customers would likely give up holding private health insurance altogether rather than purchase more expensive plans. He also noted that limited or non-existent maternity and child healthcare in private settings would lead to a similar reduction of health insurance uptake among those cohorts. With older, riskier customers making up a larger proportion of those holding health insurance, Mr Davis warned that it is \u201cinevitable\u201d that there would be \u201csignificant premium increases\u201d for both new and existing customers. \u201cEven apart from the current significant medical inflation and resulting rising claims costs, we estimate health insurance premiums for some people (eg those who currently opt for entry-level plans) could potentially double in such a scenario,\u201d he said. Exacerbate pressure The letter warned that removal of private care from public hospitals could also exacerbate existing pressure on the public system, as patients are \u201cpriced out\u201d of private healthcare. Irish Life Health suggested that the Department of Health should take a \u201cmore measured\u201d approach, where public hospitals would have designated bed capacity for privately insured patients that would reduce gradually over time and eventually be eliminated. In a statement to The Irish Times, the Department of Health said that there \u2018may be an impact on the private health insurance market as a result of the removal of private care from public hospitals\u2019 \u201cThis more gradual transition would allow time for health insurers to devise new offerings that would appeal to younger customers and solidify the system of community rating,\u201d said Mr Davis. Community rating means that insurers must charge the same amount for a given level of cover, regardless of age, sex or health status. In a statement to The Irish Times, the Department of Health said that there \u201cmay be an impact on the private health insurance market as a result of the removal of private care from public hospitals\u201d. [\u00a0 Over 40% of Sl\u00e1intecare reforms suffered delay last year, report finds \u00a0] [\u00a0 Whether Sl\u00e1intecare lives or dies is now in hands of the consultants \u00a0] \u201cThe vision of Sl\u00e1intecare is to achieve a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay. The Sl\u00e1intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023 notes that the removal of private practice from public hospitals is a core principle of Sl\u00e1intecare, ensuring that public healthcare facilities are used for public patients only, and that public patients can access public hospitals based on clinical need,\u201d said a department spokesperson. The department said that the recently introduced Public Only Sl\u00e1intecare Consultant Contract will begin to remove private care from the public system, but that a number of consultants are likely to retain existing (pre-Public Only) contracts for some time. The department added that it had asked Irish Life for its views on the matter \u201calongside other reforms being progressed under Sl\u00e1intecare to allow sufficient time to put in place the necessary improvements in capacity and care models\u201d.",

            "title": "Health insurance: How to save hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 on your policy",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2023-07-21",
            "raw_text": "Irish people are cumulatively wasting over \u20ac150 million every single year by not shopping around for health insurance. And there are hundreds of thousands of people who are paying hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of euro more than they need to for health cover because they do not make a few calls and ask the right questions. Fear over making a mistake that leaves you without cover when you need it most, confusion over the hundreds of plans to choose from and a misplaced sense of loyalty to companies that you may have been with for decades are three factors that are leading to such huge sums being spent unnecessarily. But while health insurance can undoubtedly look complex, when it\u2019s boiled down to two simple questions \u2013 is my current plan offering me value for money and could I get a comparable level of cover for less? \u2013 it becomes a whole lot simpler. While the amounts being spent unnecessarily by individuals will depend on the policies they have and the circumstances they are in, a good rule of thumb to use as a guide is that anyone who has been on the same policy for more than three years is probably overpaying by about 25 per cent. But how is that possible? It happens in multiple ways. Firstly, the three insurers operating in Ireland \u2013 VHI Healthcare, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Healthcare \u2013 all frequently roll out new plans to attract consumers into the market and the newer policies are almost always cheaper than the legacy ones. So if you are on an older plan rather than a newer one, there is a decent chance you are paying too much. How much? According to the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), the overseer of the whole sector in Ireland, people could save as much as \u20ac1,000 by switching from one older policy to another broadly similar one. And that is \u20ac1,000 per person. Despite such savings less than a third of the 2 million or so people with health insurance have changed plans over the last two years which leaves about 1.5 million people who have stayed put. And why is that? People tend to be conservative when it comes to their health insurance and they are afraid of making a mistake and taking out a policy that won\u2019t cover what they need to be covered. This fear is particularly pronounced when it comes to pre-existing conditions with many afraid to move from one provider to another in case they lose cover or have to wait for coverage to kick in. Neither of these things are true and if you have insurance with Company A and have already sat out your waiting periods with that company then if you switch to Company B then all the existing cover that you had with Company A rolls over to your new provider. If Company B offers enhanced cover you may have to wait for that to kick in but whatever you had, you keep. It is also worth noting that the benefits of switching for the older people are greater than the younger people, because they tend to be paying more for their insurance with the over 65s paying between 40 and 45 per cent more for insurance than younger people do. They also tend to be the cohort less likely to switch and much more likely to be on older \u2013 bad value \u2013 plans. So how do you switch? If you have a policy coming up for renewal \u2013 and you can only change providers when your annual contract with your existing provider ends \u2013 you should do a small bit of homework before you pick up the phone to your provider. Do not simply ring your insurer and ask the person on the other end of the line what they think you should do. Instead ask if they have a lower cost equivalent plan to the one you are on that is similar and make it clear you are happy to take on some minor reductions, depending on the savings. This call is always easiest with your existing insurer \u2013 so that should be your first call. Your existing provider will have a complete record of all previous claims so tell them everything that\u2019s important to you and detail all your underlying conditions and the procedures you\u2019ve had done, and get them to confirm that any new and cheaper plan covers everything you have had covered in the past. If that new and cheaper plan would have covered all the claims that have been paid out over the last two years and to the same level then the choice has been made for you. It is also important to speak to people rather than making modifications online. If you buy online without speaking to anyone then you are entirely responsible for the decisions you make whether it\u2019s a good or bad decision. But if you are talking to representatives of a company and ask them questions and get them to explain everything again and again until you are comfortable you understand then they have a duty of care to you that doesn\u2019t exist in the online space. Remember when talking to a provider to tell them all the relevant details of your health because they can\u2019t refuse you based on any of your answers. They can\u2019t load your policy with additional charges. They can\u2019t change the terms because you\u2019ve disclosed something. And the more specific you are with your questioning, then the more specific their answers have to be and everything is recorded. Six ways to know if you\u2019re paying too much: If you\u2019re on the same plan for five years or more or paying more than \u20ac1,850 per adult If you\u2019ve never considered corporate plans which include a small excess per claim If you\u2019re afraid to change as you think you might have to serve waiting periods again If you have all the family on the same plan or you\u2019re paying the full rate for young adult If you\u2019re not getting 50 per cent to 75 per cent back on your outpatient expenses with no excess to pay And six steps you need to take: Shop around well before your renewal date Ask for the closest equivalent plan to what you have already Disclose everything that\u2019s important to you If you\u2019re happy with the answers, just switch! Switching doesn\u2019t mean you have to change insurer as in many cases you can get a better deal with the same insurer Talk to an expert or at the very least talk to the insurers and to make sure you understand the decisions you have to make You can contact us at  OnTheMoney@irishtimes.com  with personal finance questions you would like to see us address.

            "raw_text": "Plenty of people take to social media to complain about service but not many of us make good on their threats to do something about it. Entrepreneur Jon Bayle is different though. Having gone on Twitter late last year to give out about how frustrating it was trying to obtain life insurance, he duly went out the next day and set up a new business to address the problem. \u201cLife insurance is f***ed up, especially as you get older (like me). And a nightmare if you\u2019ve anything other than a vanilla medical history. I think I\u2019m going to build something to try fix that,\u201d Mr Bayle said in a tweet posted in in November. Six months later Life & Provide, which has already secured seed financing from financial services veterans, is live. It is starting small with two products: pet insurance and renters\u2019 insurance. The latter in particular is something the company\u2019s co-founders are well acquainted with given they are also the brains behind Deposify, a start-up that provides escrow services to landlords, tenants and letting agents. \"We want to become a UX [user experience] leader in insurance. Our goal is to provide a fast and convenient customer experience for something that has traditionally been a terrible buying experience, paper heavy, lots of delay and not much transparency,\" said co-founder and chief technology officer Dave Brennan. Success Mr Bayle and Mr Brennan have already achieved considerable success with Deposify, a US-focused company that has an \u201cescrow as a service\u201d platform that allows landlords and tenants to manage and control how and when rental deposits are paid and resolve deposit-related disputes quickly. They are using what they\u2019ve learned with that business to improve the insurance-buying process. Insurance is a space the entrepreneurs know well from their experience working and competing with insurers in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that distribution is everything in start-up. We\u2019re taking what we learned in Deposify \u2013 where we sell through US partners with national reach to property managers, who in turn drive tenant adoption \u2013 to insurance. We want to go where the buyers of insurance are buying their products and services online today, embedding our technology in the checkout flow.\u201d he said. Mr Bayle said the company\u2019s investors all come from insurance and financial services backgrounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a team of experienced insurance industry advisers around us to help and we\u2019re taking a capital-light, ownership-first approach in Life & Provide, as we have done in Deposify,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have two distribution partnerships already with market leaders in real estate and pet who have significant user bases. We\u2019d love to talk to other online businesses looking to offer insurance products to their customers,\u201d Mr Bayle added.",

            "raw_text": "Over a year after the landmark Freddy Tylicki case there is still no indemnity insurance cover in place for Ireland\u2019s jockeys. Tylicki succeeded in a \u00a36 million case for damages against another Irish rider Graham Gibbons that concluded in a London High Court in late 2021. Gibbons was found liable for an incident at Kempton in 2016 that resulted in a fall which left Tylicki paralysed from the waist down. The case highlighted how, unlike their cross-channel based colleagues, riders in Ireland aren\u2019t covered for personal liability.

It has also said there is failure on both sides of the Irish Sea to appreciate the broader significance of the case in terms of jockeys possibly suing colleagues for damages in the case of personal injuries. The IJA\u2019s secretary, former amateur jockey and solicitor Andrew Coonan, has confirmed the long-running search for insurance cover for his members has been fruitless to date. He also said the matter continues to be an \u201cindustry issue\u201d that must include both Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board in terms of financing any cover for jockeys. \u201cWe are talking and trying to get something in place that would work, but at this point in time, given the very difficult insurance market, the answer is no,\u201d Coonan said when asked if after a year\u2019s efforts insurance cover is in place. \u201cWe have had various people talk to us about the possibilities about what\u2019s available, or what might be available, without necessarily putting figures on that yet. \u201cBut essentially, the background work is to try and see what cover we need, and how we can get it, and what markets are available to provide that. It all remains very much outstanding,\u201d he added. The issue is complicated by limited insurance options in this country with the IJA forced to look internationally for quotes. Last year Coonan predicted a similar case to Tylicki would occur here, pointing out: \u201cIt\u2019s not something we can just leave sitting there and say let\u2019s hope it never happens here. Because as sure as night follows day it will.\u201d He said: \u201cNothing I have seen has changed my thinking on that. Its still, in my view, a very important issue that has not yet been resolved.\u201d Freezing overnight conditions means action at Tuesday\u2019s rescheduled Clonmel fixture relies on the track passing a 7.30 morning inspection. Should it get a green light very much the \u2018talking horse\u2019 on show will be Gaelic Warrior in a two-mile conditions hurdle. The Willie Mullins-trained horse threw away his chance of Cheltenham Festival glory last March when despite persistently jumping right he only failed by a short head to Brazil. Having returned to action with a facile wide-margin victory at Tramore last month, his potential remains very much untapped. A general 7-1 shot for Cheltenham\u2019s Ballymore, Gaelic Warrior is also a 4-1 favourite for next year\u2019s Betfair Hurdle at Newbury. The new timing of the Clonmel fixture means he will only pick up a 5lb penalty should he win on Tuesday which, in theory, he ought to manage easily.",

            "raw_text": "There are indications that insurance companies may reduce motor insurance premiums as early as the summer after changes to personal injury claim payouts take effect later this month. Minister of State for financial services and insurance Se\u00e1n Fleming said he had received assurance from some firms that premiums would be cut as early as July, in anticipation of the effects of the changes. Mr Fleming said he had held several one-on-one meetings with insurance executives, to discuss the changes and anticipated reductions in premiums. \u201cI\u2019ve met most of the insurance companies. I will be concluding meetings with them this week . . . Some are saying from the 1st of July they will show a reduction in premiums,\u201d he said. Last month judges voted in favour of adopting new guidelines ensuring awards in certain personal injury cases are in line with the injuries sustained. In recent weeks the Oireachtas passed amendments to give effect to the changes, with these measures due to come into force from April 24th. Mr Fleming said while some insurance companies had signalled they would pass on \u201cup-front\u201d cuts in premiums to customers early, others stated they would wait to see the impact of the new measures. It is hoped the guidelines will reduce the numbers seeking litigation, and cut awards. Large payouts in personal injury cases, for incidents such as whiplash, have been criticised as a reason for high insurance costs. Mr Fleming said he anticipated there would be \u201cearly movers\u201d in the insurance sector, with other companies following suit in reducing motor insurance premiums by the autumn. There was no indication yet from companies on how much premiums could fall by, if the changes are successful in cutting legal costs and payouts, he said. New guidelines Moyagh Murdock, chief executive of Insurance Ireland, which represent the sector, defended the delay in passing on reductions in premiums to customers. Ms Murdock said she welcomed the new guidelines on insurance payouts. This \u201cbodes well\u201d for reduced awards for soft tissue injuries, she told RT\u00c9 radio News at One. However, she said it would take some time for cases to be \u201cflushed through the system\u201d and for savings to be seen. She noted insurance premiums had already started to come down in some cases, with reductions in the past 18 months.",

            "raw_text": "Without doubt, the housing market has been the most dysfunctional element of the Irish economy over the past decade or so. Running it close in second place would be insurance, where rising costs have placed a huge financial burden on businesses in every sector of the economy, and forced many motorists to dig deep into their pockets to stay on the road. This was well-articulated by Supermac's founder Pat McDonagh   on the business pages of The Irish Times on Monday , where he called for immediate reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) to beef up its powers in an effort to lower premium costs. As with housing, the Government has reacted to the insurance issues with many policy measures in recent years, most recently with the judicial guidelines on personal injury awards. The guidelines reduce the award levels for most categories of personal injury and should help to bring down the cost of premiums. And yet businessmen like McDonagh feel that more still needs to be done. PIAB published its annual report on Tuesday. It showed a 16 per cent reduction in the number of claims it received last year to 26,009. This was largely due to the impact of the pandemic on traffic levels and the number of road accidents, and a reduction in workplace claims as most of us worked from home. But PIAB\u2019s report shows that the numbers have been on a downward trajectory since 2016, when the level of claims topped 34,000. This might have more to do with insurers engaging directly with claimants and settling a case before it reaches PIAB. Pandemic impact There were 8,587 awards last year compared with 11,527 in 2019. The awards totalled \u20ac206 million in value versus \u20ac275 million a year earlier. The value and volume of awards have both been in retreat since 2016. Given the timelag involved in the lodging of claims, it might be next year before we know the full impact of the pandemic on insurance costs. But PIAB expects to see a \u201ccontinuing reduction in claims in 2021\u201d, and \u201cchanges to how we work and live may lead to less cars on the road, and less people working in centralised premises; all of which could hopefully lead to less accidents and therefore less claims into the future\u201d. So far so good for buyers of insurance. PIAB was established as an independent State body in 2003 to deal with claims in a cost-efficient manner, without the need to go to court. All personal injury claims must go through PIAB, but claimants can choose to litigate rather than accept a settlement. This is where the picture changes. In PIAB\u2019s annual report, its chief executive, Rosalind Carroll, noted how the Central Bank\u2019s second National Claims Information Database report on motor claims, published last November, highlighted the disparity in costs associated with cases taken through PIAB versus those going to court. In PIAB cases, the average compensation paid was \u20ac23,137 while the average legal costs amounted to \u20ac716 between 2015 and 2019. Where litigation was involved, the average compensation was \u20ac23,572 while average legal costs were a much more substantial \u20ac14,949. So there is little between the settlement figures but a vast gap in the legal fees. These are averages, of course, but the figures illustrate that there is nothing to be gained for claimants by litigating through the courts. Employer and public liability The litigation figure is for cases where the settlement was less than \u20ac100,000, which is 85 per cent of all cases that go to court. Those above that level usually involve life-changing or serious injuries, and more complexity. The figures are even more pronounced for employers\u2019 liability (EL) and public liability (PL), according to another Central Bank report earlier this month. In terms of EL, PIAB compensation averaged \u20ac36,320 while its legal costs ran to an average of \u20ac902. In cases that went to court, the compensation was \u20ac69,865 while the legal costs were a hefty \u20ac35,268. In PL cases, PIAB paid out on average \u20ac27,484 while its legal fees ran to \u20ac1,734. In litigation, the compensation was higher at \u20ac38,599 but legal fees ran to an average of \u20ac24,421. McDonagh argues that lawyers are the big winners in the current system and it\u2019s hard to disagree with him based on those figures. The other winners in recent years have been insurance companies. According to the Central Bank, motor insurers made a combined \u20ac142 million in operating profit in 2019, with their margins rising by one point to 10 per cent. The figures for 2020 will be fascinating given the impact of the pandemic. Some insurers gave customers small rebates to reflect the fact that they had been off the road during lockdown but others stubbornly refused to move. The cost of claims has also been reducing for insurers, according to the Central Bank\u2019s data. With the number of claims reducing and the cost of personal injury awards being set lower by the new judicial guidelines, insurance costs should begin to lower on a consistent basis. Data from the Central Statistics Office shows that motor insurance costs fell by 6 per cent in the year to the end of June. That\u2019s a good start but they need to go lower still, and fall across the board to ease the burden on businesses and consumers.",

            "author": "Jillian Godsil",
            "date": "2022-04-21",
            "raw_text": "The focus on green insurance is being driven mainly from the European Union. This is due to green insurance being one part of the sustainable finance jigsaw and the EU's prioritisation of sustainable finance as the path to achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan which have, at their core, the objective to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. Retail green insurance Retail green insurance refers to the new and emerging green insurance products that are being offered on the market, such as life insurance policies with underlying green investments, home insurance policies offering reduced premiums for flood proofed homes, pay-as-you-go motor insurance, and discounted insurance premiums for buildings which have been modified to be more energy efficient. John Lowe, aka the Money Doctor, talks about the impact of green insurance on his day-to-day living. He went all-in electric back in August of last year and enjoys a 511km per single change to his electric vehicle and seven totally free charging platforms 20ft from his office. \u201cCar insurance companies use a range of factors when calculating your car insurance. Some of these relate to the type of car you drive and others to you as a driver. \u201cBut in the main, electric car premiums can be up to 10 per cent cheaper than petrol or diesel car insurance. So, as well as the benefits of cheaper running and fuel costs, you can now save on your insurance premium \u2013 do shop around.\u201d Corporate green insurance Green insurance is even more relevant to the corporate world where (re)insurers conduct their business and integrate ESG and sustainability factors into their operations including, critically, into their risk-management systems, governance framework, management structures, underwriting activities, asset-management framework, investment strategy and product oversight and review procedures. Marguerite Sinnott is senior associate in insurance at William Fry LLP, which is only one of only five Irish law firms to be ranked in the inaugural The Legal 500 Global Green Guide. Sinnott explains: \u201cOur clients are very conscious that green insurance is here, is constantly evolving and covers a very broad-spectrum, including issues related to diversity and inclusion, supply-chain management, community relations. \u201c[Re] insurers are having to allocate significant resources to be and stay compliant with new sustainability requirements and we are supporting clients in the conduct of root and branch reviews of their entire business to meet regulatory, legal, supervisor and consumer demands and ultimately to deliver the overall goal of achieving sustainability at all levels of their business. \u201cThis involves advising our [re]insurer clients on their multi-faceted approach to green insurance, including from the perspective of the various roles they play in the industry, for example, as product producer [in terms of general insurance and insurance investment products], asset owner, underwriter, risk manager, long-term investor, regulated entity and financial advisor.\u201d Buyer beware \u2013 greenwashing Going green is becoming a profitable business strategy, with a new market of environment followers and supportive government policies to help the industry grow. The term originated in the 1960s when the hotel industry devised one of the most blatant examples of greenwashing. They placed notices in hotel rooms asking guests to reuse their towels to save the environment. The hotels enjoyed the benefit of lower laundry costs. Greenwashing \u2013 also called green sheen \u2013 essentially refers to the act of portraying an organisation\u2019s product or services as environmentally friendly only for the sake of marketing. In truth, the product or service doesn\u2019t have or hardly has any environmental benefits. So how can people be sure \u2018green insurance\u2019 is genuine? Sinnott says: \"Green insurance is a priority at an EU and wider global level. This is demonstrated by the raft of EU and domestic legislation, regulation and guidance published over the past several years and which continues to be published at an unprecedented pace and in large volumes. The will to further 'green' the insurance industry is also seen in EIOPA and Central Bank supervisory approaches. Although there will always be a risk of greenwashing, consumers are advised to only obtain information from reputable players and reputable sources and then fact-check the information provided to them.\" [\u00a0 Sign up for monthly Special Reports insights, delivered\u00a0straight to your inbox \u00a0]",

            "raw_text": "Arachas Corporate Brokers, the largest Irish insurance broker group, saw its net profit soar by 63 per cent last year, fuelled by acquisitions as it continued to play a leading role in ongoing consolidating the market. The company, led by chief executive Conor Brennan, said that its net profit rose to \u20ac22.9 million from almost \u20ac14 million for the previous year, according to its latest annual financial statement, filed this week with the Companies Registration Office (CRO). Revenues, mainly comprised of commissions and fees, jumped 31 per cent to \u20ac61 million. Arachas, one of the most active dealmakers in the industry in the Republic in recent years, was itself acquired in 2020 by Ardonagh, a UK brokerage group that is backed by US private equity firms Madison Dearborn and HPS Partners, for \u20ac250 million. The wider Irish market has seen a flurry of broker deals in the past six years as it followed waves of consolidation in the UK and North America. The ultimate backers of most of the purchasing vehicles are private equity firms, attracted to a sector that is fee-based and delivers steady revenues through the economic cycle. This allows buyers to service the debt needed to finance further deals. Last year saw Arachas buy Mayo-based MCM Insurance Brokers, which is focused on the construction, hospitality and professional indemnity sectors, BJP Insurance in Dublin and Kilkenny-based fintech Orange Bear Consultancy for undisclosed sums. It also agreed to purchase Waterford-based Hooper Dolan in a deal believed to be worth in excess of \u20ac60 million. Hooper Dolan\u2019s assets were officially taken over by Arachas at the start of 2022. This year has also seen Arachas seal a deal to buy family-owned Glennon Insurances in Dublin for an estimated figure of more than \u20ac90 million. At the time of the Ardonagh purchase, Arachas had set its sights of doubling within five years the \u20ac270 million of annual gross premiums it was writing for everything from plumbers to sporting organisations. The Hooper Dolan and Glennon transactions have helped it achieve that target ahead of schedule. Arachas, where former minister for finance Charlie McCreevy in an independent director, has also agreed to buy Dublin-based Stuart Insurances and Apex Insurance in Cork this year. \u201cArachas is currently trading well as we continue to enhance the insurance solutions we provide customers and integrate more recent acquisitions,\u201d said John McCarthy, chief financial officer of Arachas. The latest accounts for Arachas also show that the company had a loan of \u20ac750,000 out to Mr Brennan as of the end of last year, carrying an annual interest rate of 13.5 per cent. The loan was repaid on January 1st. The loan was part of the wider group\u2019s management incentive scheme that allowed executives to purchase shares in the company and has subsequently been paid back in full,\u201d a spokesman for Arachas said.",

            "raw_text": "Irish society\u2019s growing acceptance and normalisation of insurance fraud is encouraging false and exaggerated claims and providing \u201can income supplement to the morally challenged\u201d, according to the head of claims at the State\u2019s largest public sector insurer. Michael Whelehan, head of claims at the IPB Insurance, which covers public bodies, councils and the HSE, told a conference organised by Insurance Ireland yesterday that courts must not only throw out fabricated and inflated claims, but impose costs and prison sentences on fraudsters. Insurance fraudsters in Ireland are \u201cwalking free from courts effectively with the message to spin the wheel again\u201d, said Mr Whelehan, whose organisation paid out almost \u20ac113 million against claims last year. \u201cAll I ask \u2013 and we as a society should demand \u2013 is that on the roulette wheel we can expect the existing law to be implemented with vigour,\u201d said Mr Whelehan. \u201cI think the roulette wheel must include costs, dismissals, fines and imprisonment as realistic propositions.\u201d Mr Whelehan said that if insurance fraud is not tackled \u201cwith more vigour\u201d the cost to society of funding opportunistic fraud will increase. \u201cLocal services will be constrained, leisure and amenities curtailed, funds diverted, and we will continue to fund the making of insurance claims and exaggerated insurance claims as an income supplement to the morally challenged,\u201d he said. Whiplash The Personal Injuries Commission found last year that compensation for whiplash claims in Ireland were running at an average of \u20ac17,388, more than four times the rate in the UK. Insurers and consumer advocates argue that this is contributing to false and exaggerated claims. The insurance industry faced political and public ire as motor premiums rose \u2013 according to Central Statistics Office data \u2013 by more than 70 per cent in the three years to late 2016. While motor coverage costs have since fallen by more than 20 per cent, public liability and employers\u2019 liability premiums have been rising dramatically in recent times. \u201cBusinesses are failing because of rising insurance costs\u201d, Deirdre Carwood, a partner with Deloitte, told the conference. Guidelines Industry observers expect that a personal injury committee being set up under the Judicial Council Act, enacted in July, will issue guidelines as soon as next year that will lead to court awards falling and becoming more consistent. Insurance Ireland interim chief executive Gerry Hassett said that this, in turn, will bring down insurance premiums. Chief Justice, Mr Justice Frank Clarke, said he has identified members of the committee in the hope that they will be able to \u201chit the ground running\u201d. The committee-designate includes judges from the High Court, Court of Appeals, as well as District and Circuit courts, Mr Justice Clarke said. A spokesman for the Courts Service of Ireland said he was not in a position to name the committee members. The Chief Justice said the members of the committee will be able to start work in the meantime on benchmarking of personal injury awards against other jurisdictions. Mr Justice Clarke did not say when the council will be set up. He said it is important it is established in a way that does not make it susceptible to \u201cunnecessary legal challenge\u201d which will slow the process. \u201cToday we got no timeline for when the work of the committee would be complete,\u201d said Peter Boland, spokesman for the Alliance for Insurance Reform. \u201cFrom policyholders\u2019 perspective, progress appears unbearably slow.\u201d",

            "raw_text": "Sir, \u2013 We would like to respond to the recent article \u201cHospitality sector sees insurance premiums falling by up to 30 per cent\u201d (Business, September 27th), which references improvements in insurance accessibility and affordability within the hospitality sector. It is heartening to hear that some in the hospitality sector are witnessing reductions in insurance premiums and improved policy options. However, we are concerned that the article may give rise to an impression of industry-wide improvements. As the main representative bodies for hotels, restaurants and publicans, such an impression would not accord with the reality of the vast majority of our member organisations who continue to struggle to secure affordable insurance cover, with many members telling us about premium increases on a regular basis and a lack of underwriters willing to insure hospitality businesses. This is despite the many structural improvements made to Ireland\u2019s insurance market in recent years, including the introduction of the judicial guidelines to replace the book of quantum, and the recently commenced reforms to the duty of care. Moreover, the total number of personal injury claims submitted to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) is down by 46 per cent between 2016 and 2022, with the average PIAB public liability assessment down 39 per cent compared to the average 2020 assessment under the old book of quantum. A recently published Central Bank report showed a 12 per cent reduction in the total cost of settled injury claims to H1 2022 from the 2015-2019 pre-Covid average. Taken together, it makes a compelling argument for reduced premiums. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Premium reductions of the order mentioned in the article (20 per cent to 30 per cent) should be anticipated on foot of these reforms and are a sign to others in the insurance market of what is now expected. However, for the majority of businesses working in the hospitality sector this has yet to materialise. Rather than prematurely celebrating what might still prove to be a false dawn, it is imperative that the Government continue to hold insurers\u2019 feet to the fire until these tentative signs of premium improvements become a sector-wide reality. \u2013 Yours, etc, TIM FENN, Irish Hotels Federation; ADRIAN CUMMINS, Restaurant Association of Ireland; DONALL O\u2019KEEFFE, Licenced Vintners Association; PADRAIG CRIBBEN, Vintners Federation of Ireland, Dublin 14.",

            "date": "2022-07-15",
            "raw_text": "Celtic Tiger-era building defects are affecting up to 100,000 properties across the State, with a potential bill of \u20ac2.8 billion to fix these issues. Unfortunately for the owners of these buildings, there are few options when it comes to trying to find someone to foot the bill \u2014 even if an insurance policy is in place. What are the housing defects? Fire-safety issues have been found to be the most prevalent form of defect, present in 40-70 per cent of affected homes; with water ingress present in between 20-50 per cent, and structural safety defects the least common in about 5-25 per cent of homes, according to the working group established by Minister for Housing Darragh O\u2019Brien to look at the issue. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 And just how common is it? It is understood the working group has found that problems such as a lack of fire-safety material, structural defects and water ingress are present in up to 80 per cent of apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013, which equates to 62,500-100,000 units. But why doesn\u2019t insurance just cover the cost of fixing defects? This is where things get complicated. According to Lydia Bunni, a barrister specialising in the area of construction, most construction contracts have a claims made policy of insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s not the policy of insurance that was in place when these apartment blocks were being built, it\u2019s the policy of insurance that\u2019s in place today or whenever the claim is made that pays out. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d she said. If the contractor who built the apartment has gone under, then there is no insurance policy in place, she added. But if the contractor is still in business, does the insurance have to pay out then? More often than not, the answer is no, due to the way the policies were designed, and the ownership structure of apartment blocks. Ms Bunni said: \u201cWithin the insurance policy itself, there will be very specific prerequisites that have to be complied with, prior to the insurance company agreeing to indemnify the insured. Sometimes the insurance company simply doesn\u2019t cover the defect that has arisen.\u201d Another barrister specialising in construction, Dr Deirdre N\u00ed Fhloinn, said when you buy an apartment you enter into a long leasehold, which is typically a 500-year lease. \u201cEach person has a leasehold, which means they don\u2019t own the whole building. The structure and the common areas are usually owned by a management company,\u201d she said. \u201cUsually the owners\u2019 management company doesn\u2019t really have an avenue to go after the original builder under the law of contracts if a defect subsequently appears in the building.\u201d As a result, homeowners typically took out their own individual policies. However, generally these products were intended for major structural defects, meaning the likes of water ingress and fire safety were not covered. Have insurers paid out on any of these defects? According to N\u00ed Fhloinn, water ingress was covered in some instances, but fire-stopping problems was not generally covered by these warranty policies. Under the Homebond Scheme, water ingress and certain physical fire-safety risks are only covered for five years, but many of these issues only arising after this period has lapsed. So is legal action not an option? The cost of litigation is a prohibitive factor, according to N\u00ed Fhloinn, who added that there is \u201ccomplexity\u201d in bringing a case forward if you are one owner out of 10 in a development. \u201cThe structure that\u2019s adopted for the ownership and management of apartment blocks doesn\u2019t lend itself to litigating easily when it comes to a problem that affects the whole building,\u201d she added. Furthermore, if an individual notices the defect outside the statutory six-year limit, Ms Bunni said any legal action is essentially a \u201clost cause\u201d. \u201cOnce the defect manifests itself in terms of taking a case, the time starts to run. Whereas maybe there needs to be a legislation change for a discoverability test. So time will only start to run from the time you discover the defect,\u201d she said. \u201cFire safety and firestopping as a defect manifests itself the moment the building is completed if not earlier. You\u2019re never going to discover that defect until possibly it\u2019s too late, as in most of these cases.\u201d So homeowners are liable for these costs? Essentially, in many cases, yes. N\u00ed Fhloinn said: \u201cSo if there is a defect in your building, and it\u2019s not covered by a warranty policy, and the original contractor is either someone you can\u2019t sue or a limited company that doesn\u2019t have any money or any insurance, then what you\u2019re left with is the apartment owners themselves having to collectively come up with the money.\u201d However, it looks like Government intervention will be on the way, with T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar telling the D\u00e1il on Thursday that there will have to be Government assistance for people who purchased apartments affected by construction defects.",

            "raw_text": "A move to ban dual pricing where insurance companies impose a \u201cloyalty penalty\u201d on customers who stay with the same provider will be delayed for at least another nine months while the Government does \u201cgreater analysis of the complex issues involved\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in finance spokesman Pearse Doherty introduced a Bill in the D\u00e1il to end \"price gouging\" of consumers where existing customers pay a more expensive premium than new customers despite having similar risk profiles. Mr Doherty, who has campaigned on the issue for almost two years, said his Insurance (Restriction on Differential Pricing and Profiling) Bill is based on legislation from Britain that he claimed will this year ban the practice of dual pricing. \u201cIrish consumers deserve no less,\u201d he said. It is expected a ban on the practice would cut premiums by up to 27 per cent for home owners who have renewed up to 10 times and up to 34 per cent for motorists, and would benefit 77 per cent of motor insurance policies and 67 per cent of home insurance policies. Although the Government will not oppose the legislation, it has called for the Bill to be reconsidered in nine months\u2019 time \u201cto allow for greater analysis of the complex issues concerned following the publication of the Central Bank\u2019s final report on differential pricing later this year\u201d. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the Central Bank would issue a final report on the issue at the end of the year and it was appropriate the independent regulator be allowed to complete that report. He also said accurate comparisons should be made with action by other jurisdictions. The British authorities had published proposals, but they are subject to further feedback followed by a policy statement with implementation next year, he said. The Government has serious concerns about the Bill, he said, and the difficulties it could create for insurance companies to actually offer discounts or for the ability of new insurance providers and suppliers into the market or existing providers to provide coverage in areas they have not previously covered. \u201cThat is a legitimate concern,\u201d he said pointing to the childcare sector where just two insurers offered coverage. Mr Doherty said insurers in Ireland \u201crip off\u201d their customers and charge consumers \u201cmuch higher prices than the actual cost of their policies\u201d. Companies identify customers who are likely to renew \u201cand then charge them the highest price possible before they\u2019re tempted to switch to a competitor\u201d. \u201cInstead of rewarding you for your loyalty they increase your premium in the knowledge that you are more likely to renew than to switch. That is the loyalty penalty.\u201d He gave the example of Ray, who received a renewal quota for his car from Liberty Insurance for \u20ac1,420, but it was \u20ac680 when he went online for the exact same policy from the same provider \u2013 a price difference of \u20ac740, the \"loyalty premium\". The Central Bank carried out an investigation after he made a complaint and in December last year reported that dual pricing affects more than seven in 10 Irish policy holders. More than 20 states in the United States \u2013 including New York, California and Florida \u2013 banned the practice, and in Britain the regulator found that in 2018 six million policy holders were overcharged a combined \u20ac1.4 billion. Under the Bill\u2019s provisions renewing customers will no longer be charged artificially high prices based on their likeliness to renew, their spending practices, economic background or any other trait not linked to risk. Labour finance spokesman Ged Nash pointed out fewere thabn half of Irish consumers change their energy provider while fewer than one in four switch insurance companies while last than 0.03 per cent of customers changed to a different bank. He said customers do not change for numerous reasons including the time involved, and the difficulty in keeping up with complex insurance policy offerings. Social Democrats joint leader R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall said \u201cthe Central Bank is not sufficiently consumer focused\u201d and did not collect enough data on vulnerable customers, market concentration and market volatility.",

            "raw_text": "The European Union needs to rethink its policies to make a 2035 ban on new petrol car sales feasible as electric vehicles (EVs) remain unaffordable and alternative fuel options are not credible, the EU\u2019s external auditor said, jeopardising its 2050 climate goals. The 27-member bloc wants to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, meaning it will emit no more than it can balance out with measures to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as reforestation programmes. It hopes to meet its targets with the widespread use of electric vehicles as road transport accounts for nearly a quarter of its emissions. The EU wants to have at least 30 million zero-emission cars on European roads by 2030, or about 12 per cent of the current car fleet. However, the European Court of Auditors cautioned the bloc may create new economic dependencies and hurt its own industry. As it stands, high EV production costs in Europe means the bloc will have to rely on cheap imports, mainly from China, if it sticks to the 2035 goal. China accounts for 76 per cent of EV battery output compared with the EU that represents less than 10 per cent of production globally. \u201cThe EU faces a conundrum, how to meet goals without harming industrial policy and hurting consumers,\u201d Annemie Turtelboom, a European Court of Auditors member, told reporters. She added that 2026 will be a key year for a policy review. Tesla is the leading EV maker in the United States and Europe but has come under pressure to slash prices due to competition from Chinese cars. Similarly, European carmakers like Stellantis that owns Peugeot and Fiat, and Renault are now racing to develop their own affordable EV models. While EV purchases have been on the rise in the EU, the increase was largely due to subsidies. In addition, charging infrastructure is lacking with 70 per cent of charging points concentrated in just Germany, France and the Netherlands. The EU is falling short of its aim to set up one million charging stations across the bloc. \u201c[EV] prices would need to halve and subsidies do not seem to be a viable tool ... Batteries alone already costs \u20ac15,000 when produced in Europe,\u201d Ms Turtelboom added when speaking to reporters. Alternative fuels like biofuels, e-fuels or hydrogen remain uneconomic at commercial scale. Adding to the difficulties in hitting its 2050 goal, the court said the EU has not cut real carbon dioxide emissions from cars despite new testing standards and measures such as Euro 6. In a January report, the European Court of Auditors attributes this to the gap between laboratory tests and real world emission tests. The Commission was relying on lab tests, which created a skewed version. In reality, average emissions from diesel cars are unchanged from 2010 at 170 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometre while petrol cars are just down 4.6 per cent at over 160g carbon dioxide per kilometre. \u201cDespite lofty ambitions and strict requirements, most conventional cars still emit as much carbon dioxide as 12 years ago.\u201d European Court of Auditors member Nikolaos Milionis said in a statement, attributing part of the failure to a rise in the average weight of cars. \u2013 Reuters",

            "raw_text": "An insurance company which deducted a salesman\u2019s monthly wages from his last pay packet in what they said was a bid to claw back bonus payments owed to them has been ordered to pay back the money. In a decision published on Tuesday, the  Workplace Relations Commission  ruled Ur Insurances (Europe) Ltd, trading as Actual Insurances, had \u201csimply no basis\u201d for claiming the worker, Alan Rooney, owed it nearly \u20ac5,000 worth of commission payments back. Denying a complaint of unlawful wage deductions under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 by Mr Rooney, the company claimed the worker was missing his sales targets and had been overpaid commission. Mr Rooney told the employment tribunal at a hearing in June 2023 that the company\u2019s actions in deducting the entire net amount of his final month\u2019s gross salary of \u20ac2,500 when he resigned in February that year were \u201coutrageous\u201d. The WRC was told the company processed the payment through payroll, and paid income tax to the Revenue Commissioners, but then deducted \u20ac2,138.58 from his net salary \u2013 all of take-home pay for the month, the tribunal noted. Company director Albert Noonan gave evidence that there was a \u201clack of sales . . . for a while\u201d by Mr Rooney. His fellow director, Ger Noonan, said the complainant had been getting half commission to \u201cencourage him\u201d. The company\u2019s position was that there was a \u201cdeficit\u201d in Mr Rooney\u2019s targets and that it was \u201centitled to claw back the commissions previously paid\u201d, the tribunal noted. The directors maintained their company was owed back \u20ac4,932 by Mr Rooney. Mr Rooney\u2019s evidence was that any commission he received was paid to him for a month when he hit his targets. What is behind Bitcoin's remarkable recovery? He told the WRC the firm was \u201ctrying to confuse the commission structure and basic salary\u201d and that his failure to meet sales targets after receiving earlier commission targets was \u201cnot the same thing as overpayment\u201d. He explained that there had been a monthly sales target of \u20ac8,000 while he was there \u2013 a \u201crolling target\u201d which would see any shortfall added to the following month\u2019s goal, so that a \u20ac6,000 sales total would lead to a \u20ac10,000 target the following month. Mr Rooney said there were \u201cups and downs\u201d in his sales during his time at Actual Insurances and that he ultimately resigned because of a combination of the stress of the role and the deficit in his sales target which had built up. In his decision on the case, adjudicator David James Murphy said the worker\u2019s salary for his last month on the job was \u201cof course properly payable to him\u201d. Mr Murphy said the company had attempted to rely on the defence of an overpayment of wages to justify the deduction, but that it had \u201cat no time overpaid the complainant\u201d. On the directors\u2019 argument that they clawed back the sum because they became \u201cunhappy\u201d with his performance, Mr Murphy added that there was \u201cno suggestion\u201d Mr Rooney ever agreed to a deduction or that a proposal to take the deduction was ever put to him. \u201cThere is simply no basis to assert the complainant owes or owed the respondent \u20ac4,932,\u201d he said. He ordered the firm to pay Mr Rooney \u20ac2138.58 for his net wages in February 2023.

            "title": "Do I need travel insurance for my holidays or is it a waste of money?",
            "author": "Conor Pope",
            "date": "2023-06-23",
            "raw_text": "The short answer to the question, if travel insurance is waste of money, is a big no. In fact,  travel insurance  is almost certainly one of the best value financial products on the market and while it is to be hoped that you will never have to use it, you might find having a policy will save you a huge amount of heartache in some of the worst case scenarios. The summer holiday season is well and truly upon us and while many people will be giddily packing suitcases and  pricing sun-creams in European tourist hot spots  in the days ahead a significant percentage of Irish people - as much to 40 per cent in fact - will forget to pack what is, arguably, the most important thing of all - travel insurance. Many will not bother with it if they are travelling in Europe because they assume they will be okay on the basis that they will be treated in public hospitals in France, Spain, Italy or wherever at no cost. And that is true up to a point. What does my European Health Insurance Card cover? If you fall ill while in the EU you will be treated in that country\u2019s health system just like you would be if you were a citizen of that country - although to be sure of that you will need a European Health Insurance Card. However, in the absence of travel insurance people will have absolutely no protection if they have to cancel a trip before they leave home or curtail a trip while they are away because of an illness to themselves or a loved one. We frequently hear from people who have suffered some misfortune and are upset with airlines or tour operators because they have been refused refunds or at the very least the opportunity to reschedule trips. While the upset on the part of those who contact us is entirely understandable, so too is the position adopted by the companies. If a trip has to be cancelled because one of the travelling party breaks a limb or needs to have a minor surgery, a travel operator will almost certainly refuse to entertain any request for a refund or rebooking. They will point out that that is exactly what travel insurance is for and they can\u2019t be expected to pick up the tab for every illness and misfortune that befalls their customers. It is also worth pointing out that in our experience if trips have to be cancelled for much more serious reasons - such as bereavements or very grave illnesses, travel companies tend to be more sympathetic. Then there is the fact that having access to the public health system in the EU will make little difference to a person who is the victim of a crime and it will most likely not get them home to Ireland in an air ambulance. What will it cost if I get sick on holidays? In any discussion about the worth or otherwise of travel insurance, it is worth nothing how much treatments cost overseas. It is a big world and the answer to that question depends on where in that world a person is and what they are being treated for. An urgent hip replacement in a private hospital in the UK will cost around \u20ac30,000 while emergency brain surgery in New Zealand will cost at least twice that while if a person has a massive heart attack in the US they can expect to face a bill of at \u20ac200,000. In short, travel insurance can make life a whole lot easier for less than \u20ac100 a year for a multi-trip policy covering a family of five. And bear in mind that the cheapest travel insurance policy on the market is often not the best value one. The price difference with more expensive policies can be - relatively speaking - very small but the level of cover they offer can be substantial. And it is important to stress the need to pay at least some attention to the fine print. It can run to some policies of more than 20,000 words which is too much for anyone to digest but it people need to at the very least look at the size of the excesses and the exclusions. What does travel insurance cover? For instance, phones are not covered in many cases, while other valuables can lose their cover if they are not in the presence of the insured at all times. And, if a person has not been storing a passport in a hotel safe when it is stolen, they can almost certainly forget about making a claim for its theft from the room. Rather than reading the policy document in full, download a PDF version or copy the text into Microsoft Word and search for \u201cnot covered\u201d, \u201cexcluded\u201d and \u201cexclusions\u201d. At least that will give you a sense of what not covered by your policy. It is also key - this summer more than any other to make sure policies cover travel disruption. Many cheaper policies do not cover travel rearrangement expenses, accommodation and cancellations relating to \u201cnatural disasters\u201d outside of weather disruption or industrial action and if that travel disruption cover, can cost more although not a whole lot - and such an add-on might only cost \u20ac15. If someone does have to make a claim, they will need to inform the insurer immediately as soon as they realise they can\u2019t go on the trip or need to cut it short. And anyone who is the victim of a crime overseas will have to contact the police in the first instance. Without an official police report, a claim will not be entertained by an insurer. And that official complaint will have to be made quickly. If a police report is delayed by more than 24 hours, an insurance company might view a claim with scepticism. Oh, and one final point. If a person is already away and does not have travel insurance it is not too late to take a policy out although it is worth bearing in mind that policies taken out while overseas don\u2019t tend to kick in for between 24 and 72 hours after being bought in order to stop people taking out policies after being the victim of a crime or falling ill.

            "raw_text": "Insurers are \u201cpocketing the benefits\u201d of the Government\u2019s insurance reform plan and are taking it and policyholders \u201cfor a ride\u201d, according to the Alliance for Insurance Reform (AIR). Alliance director Peter Boland welcomed more progress in the Government\u2019s plan for reform as outlined in a report issued on Monday, but said key reforms still needed to be implemented, including legislation to rebalance occupiers\u2019 duty of care and for reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). Insurance Ireland chief executive Moyagh Murdock said it supports insurance reform and remains committed to passing on the benefits to consumers, as evidenced from recent CSO data showing motor insurance premiums have fallen 43 per cent since 2016 and by 10 per cent year-on-year. The action plan, published in December 2020, sets out 66 actions to make Ireland\u2019s insurance sector \u201cmore competitive and consumer-friendly\u201d. According to the latest report, some 90 per cent of actions are completed or are ongoing.

That was 24 years ago\u2019 Completed actions include the coming into effect of guidelines for the slashing of awards of general damages for mainly minor personal injuries approved by judges in April 2021. According to Minister for Justice Helen McEntee, average general damages awards have fallen from \u20ac21,850 to \u20ac11,853. Other completed actions include legislation to strengthen the law on perjury and the establishment of an office to promote competition and an insurance fraud co-ordination office. By the end of this year the Government says it intends to complete reform of legislation concerning the duty of care owed by occupiers and reform of the PIAB. T\u00e1naiste Leo Varadkar said that while there had been good progress in implementing the action plan its success would be measured by whether the reforms would result in reduced premiums and increased available of insurance. \u201cWhile we have seen some evidence of improvement of availability of insurance, we have only seen premiums decrease for motorists to date.\u201d Noting that \u201ca lag time\u201d between implementing the reform and people seeing the benefits was expected, he said the insurance reform sub-group would actively review developments in the sector, monitor price changes and actively engage with stakeholders to resolve issues in the market. Mr Boland, whose organisation represents 48 community and business groups, noted that there have been \u201cserious\u201d reductions in the total number of personal injury claims over the past five years and more recently in average personal injury awards and numbers of claimants heading to litigation. However, since the implementation of the new guidelines, liability renewals have actually increased by 16 per cent, he said. \u201cLiability insurers are pocketing the benefits of the reforms and it is up to Government to get serious with them to ensure that the benefits are passed on in premium reductions to SMEs, voluntary and community groups, charities and sports and cultural organisations struggling with the costs of staying open,\u201d said Mr Boland. Eoin McCambridge, another director of AIR, said insurers \u201care taking liability policyholders and the Government for a ride\u201d, and damaging the credibility of the reform programme. Ms Murdock said the reform progress made so far should be underpinned by the pending legislation on PIAB, rebalancing of the duty of care and increased competition in the market, particularly in the area of business insurance. It is \u201ccrucial\u201d that PIAB\u2019s ability to settle cases is strengthened so that fewer cases go to the courts \u201cwhere the legal costs add so much to the overall cost of settling claims\u201d, she said. The proportion of claimants using the PIAB system is \u201cworryingly low\u201d despite claimants receiving roughly the same level of award whether opting for litigation or PIAB.",

Shareholder payouts The group\u2019s UK parent said on Wednesday that it planned to give more money back to shareholders as it posted a better-than-expected 14 per cent rise in first-half operating profit, helped by a strong performance in commercial lines. Aviva, which has significant businesses in Britain, Canada and Ireland, is under pressure from activist investor Cevian Capital, a holder of 6 per cent of the insurer\u2019s shares, to boost investor payouts. Aviva has already given \u00a34.75 billion (\u20ac5.6 billion) back to shareholders after raising \u00a37.5 billion following a string of disposals around the globe since Amanda Blanc was appointed chief executive in July 2020.

            "raw_text": "While most people will shop around for car or house insurance, we are far less likely to do so for our health insurance. Changing a plan or provider means getting to grips with what we\u2019re actually covered for and what we\u2019re not. Many of us live in blissful ignorance until the time comes where we need to hand over a policy number and we cross our fingers hoping that we are covered. But you are more important than your car. Health insurance is not an easy topic to take on, but it is worth setting aside time annually to review your options. Not only will you become more familiar with the terminology, making it easier each time, but as your needs and financial situation changes over the years, your cover should adapt too. Thankfully, free, impartial help is at hand. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is a government body that is a statutory regulator of the private health insurance market. Through its online Health Insurance Comparison tool, email service and phone line, you can cut through the noise to compare the benefits and prices of all private health insurance plans available on the Irish market, including corporate plans. We caught up with a consumer affairs specialist from the HIA to get the answers to some commonly asked questions. What are the main ways people can reduce their health insurance costs? Peoples\u2019 circumstances, particularly with Covid-19, have changed. Some will be looking at cancelling their health insurance, and insurers have allowed for certain circumstance changes for people who have lost their jobs or are on reduced hours. If you are up for renewal, finding it hard to make payments or finding it very expensive, now is the time to take a look at your health insurance and contact your insurer. Close to 50 per cent of policy holders are up for renewal during the next three months. Think of the long-term and the year ahead. People often reduce the level of cover for their children or young adults as they might not need the same level of cover as adults. That\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t realise - many think policies are family plans and that everyone has to have the same cover, but that\u2019s not the case. Everyone is priced individually; look at everybody\u2019s needs; you can be on different plans but on the same policy. Kids and parents might be better served with different insurance providers, so you\u2019ll have different policy numbers but the renewal date will be the same. Are there any other waiting periods that catch people out? For any other inpatient cover, if you are upgrading and you have a pre-existing condition, you will have a two year waiting period for the higher level of cover. So if you\u2019re going from a 90 per cent cardiac cover to full cover, the difference will be subject to a two year upgrade rule. If you\u2019re upgrading and you don\u2019t have a pre-existing condition that would relate to the higher level of cover, you\u2019ll get the higher level of cover right away. If you\u2019re planning on starting a family, how soon should you update your plan? Maternity cover is a minimum benefit on all plans. However, many plans may not have full maternity cover which will be important if you want to go semi-private or private with a pregnancy. Anytime anyone is changing their level of cover, you need to be vigilant of the waiting periods that will apply while changing, and that would apply in the future if you were to change back. Maternity has its own waiting periods; it is 52 weeks for any higher level of cover. Many people don\u2019t realise fertility treatment may be covered on your policy. Fertility treatment is a relatively new benefit, and policies may give you a benefit towards certain tests or procedures. Fertility cover has its own waiting period which can be up to 104 weeks. If you are considering starting a family in the near future it may be something to consider when renewing your policy. What should people look out for when choosing an excess? Your excess is a fixed amount that you have to pay if you make a claim. Consumers should look to see if their plan has an excess. Changing an excess, or choosing a plan that has an excess if your plan does not, can help reduce the cost of your premium. Having an excess of \u20ac200 means you\u2019ll pay the first \u20ac200 \u2013 any charge above that amount your insurer will pay. What should people look out for on the cooling-off period? It\u2019s easy to be caught out on the cooling-off period. If you are changing or thinking of changing, you have 14 days from the date of the renewal. So if your renewal is the 1st, you have until the 14th, not the 15th. Are there any pre-existing conditions that an insurer will automatically refuse? No, insurers have to provide cover. However, a waiting period of two years will apply for pre-existing conditions. What type of plan should I consider if I have a pre-existing condition? What matters is the level of cover you\u2019re on. If you\u2019re someone who has high blood pressure or if you have a particular cardiac condition, focus on the cardiac part of your policy and make sure you have good cover in the high-tech hospitals. They have the ability and technology to deal with more complex conditions. Be wary of saving \u20ac100 on your policy if it means you lose access to the high-tech hospitals, and watch out for changes to co-payments. If you go from full orthopedic cover to a co-payment, then if you have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, you might now have to pay something towards orthopedic procedures that you didn\u2019t previously. It might not be worth the initial saving. What is a good age to at which to start private health insurance? With Lifetime Community Rating (LCR), people have been prompted to take out health insurance before they are 35 because at 35 a loading will apply. If you\u2019re 34 and below and you take out health insurance for the first time, you just pay your premium. There\u2019s no additional amount. From 35 and onwards you pay an additional 2 per cent loading on the plan you pick, and the loading increases by 2 per cent every year. So at 35 it is 2 per cent, 36 is 4 per cent, 37 is 6 per cent and so on. The maximum is 70 per cent which applies for 10 years and will then cease to apply. ERSI research has shown that people with health insurance are more likely to avail of potentially life-saving cancer screening tests. Why is this? Health insurance has evolved over the last number of years to include a focus on preventative care. A lot of the plans are introducing incentives, you might get money back if you join a gym or get a Fitbit, or you may be entitled to a benefit towards preventative screening such as cardiac or cancer screenings. It\u2019s all about trying to encourage people to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Many young adults may feel they are not getting value for money out of their health insurance, however newer plans may give additional incentives like physio visits, sports massages and even travel insurance.

            "raw_text": "With nearly a million people on public health waiting lists, having another option in the event of illness, injury or poor health is becoming increasingly important. The public health system isn\u2019t entirely free, either; if you end up in hospital you will pay \u20ac80 a night, up to a maximum of \u20ac800 in a year, if you don\u2019t have a medical card (Covid-19 patients are exempt from this). This charge applies even to children older than six weeks. Of course, opting for the private route won\u2019t necessarily obviate the waiting times entirely \u2013 dermatologists operating in the private sector across the State for example, have extensive waiting lists. But it should, at least, offer you a faster route and some alternative options. But, while you might think that having appropriate cover is important, you will also want to ensure that you don\u2019t overpay for your cover either \u2013 particularly given all the cost of living pressures at the moment. Remember also, if you\u2019re on a cheaper policy, you might want to upgrade it as you get older because of the waiting periods that apply for new illnesses. As Dermot Goode of  totalhealthcover.ie  notes, \"the time to take out health cover is when you are healthy, which means your cover kicks in immediately for accidents and after six months for new medical conditions, whereas if you wait until you have an existing medical problem, then you may find that this condition will be excluded for up to five years on all policies\". So here we take a look at options for private health insurance cover based on the budget you might have, whether you\u2019re a first-time customer or looking to upgrade your cover. Entry level (\u20ac500-\u20ac600) Given price increases in recent years, a so-called budget health insurance option will now cost you at least \u20ac500 a year. But what do you get? According to John Haigney, health insurance adviser with Lyons Financial Services, these entry-level plans primarily focus on public hospitals. They typically offer a private or semi-private room in a public hospital (unlikely that you would get one, but still), and certain day-case procedures in private hospitals, as well as some money back on a host of day-to-day expenses. So, while you might get cover for an MRI in an approved treatment centre, such as VHI\u2019s Swiftcare, for example, you will have difficulty accessing other services in private hospitals. And you can forget about cover for pricier \u201chigh-tech\u201d hospitals. \u201cYou won\u2019t be going near Blackrock or the Beacon,\u201d says Goode. If your budget is in this bracket, you could consider the VHI\u2019s Public Plus Care policy, which has the distinction of being the cheapest policy on the market. It costs \u20ac504 per adult/\u20ac140 per child per year. Alternatively, you could upgrade to the Public Plus Care Day-to-Day policy, which, for an extra \u20ac31 a year, will give you better outpatient benefits, such as \u20ac20 back for each of up to three GP visits and a similar benefit for a physio. Laya has a similar plan, Assure Protect, for \u20ac518 per adult/\u20ac158 per child, but watch out for the small print. The family excess on the policy for accessing outpatient benefits is a hefty \u20ac450 a year. This means that you\u2019ll only start benefiting from money back on day-to-day medical expenses once you go over this limit. Policies do have variations, however, so it\u2019s worth paying close attention. Irish Life\u2019s Kick Off Plan, for example, is a bit more expensive, at \u20ac627, but does offer 65 per cent cover on a semi-private room in a private hospital. It also comes with free travel insurance. You can also consider a so-called \u201ccash plan\u201d, such as HSF\u2019s One Scheme. Unlike the previously mentioned policies, this doesn\u2019t offer you cover for hospital stays but offers cash back towards a host of medical expenses. Its \u201c3\u201d scheme costs \u20ac565 a year, and will give you \u20ac300 a year back on the cost of GP visits, \u20ac450 for dental and optical costs, \u20ac370 towards consultant visits and \u20ac75 a night for the cost of hospital, for up to 40 nights. Such a policy can be useful for everyday costs. But, while it offers money back on consultant costs, it won\u2019t give you access to the private care route in public hospitals. In short, as Haigney notes, the cheaper the premium, the more excesses, exclusions and shortfalls you\u2019ll experience. \u201cI would always recommend that people do have a certain level of access to private hospitals; having access to private hospitals is how you get seen a lot quicker,\u201d he says. Upgrade (about \u20ac950-\u20ac1,400) The key difference between policies at this price level and the \u20ac500-\u20ac600 level is that they cover both public and private hospitals \u2013 although you might find a shortfall on certain hospitals or treatments. Goode explains the difference between these policies and the entry-level ones, by analogy to comprehensive and third-party car insurance, respectively. VHI\u2019s First Care 250 day-to-day policy (\u20ac899), for example, offers up to 75 per cent back in certain private hospitals, but no cover in the Blackrock, Mater Private or Beacon, while Laya\u2019s Signify offers cover with a \u20ac300 shortfall in certain private hospitals. It offers cover for the Mater Private and Blackrock, but not the Beacon. As Haigney notes, the problem with having selective hospital cover is if you are referred to a consultant, a specialist in your area of need, and they only work out of certain hospitals. Irish Life Health has a similar plan \u2013 Benefit Access 300 (\u20ac907) \u2013 which offers cover for private hospitals but has a \u20ac2,000 co-payment on listed cardiac and orthopaedic procedures. If you can spend more, about \u20ac1,350, you\u2019ll come into the realm of corporate plans, which offer a more comprehensive offering. First off, you can expect a lower excess on your policy \u2013 if there is one at all \u2013 for outpatient expenses, while you are also likely to get more money back each time. Laya\u2019s Inspire Plus (\u20ac1,345) policy has an excess of just \u20ac1, and offers 50 per cent back on outpatient benefits up to \u20ac1,000 a year. Secondly, you can expect cardio cover in high-tech hospitals. \u201cAll those [corporate] plans cover major heart surgeries, valve repair etc in Blackrock, Beacon/Mater Private,\u201d says Goode. Aged 50+ (about \u20ac1,600) As you get older, your priorities might change; where, once, decent outpatient cover was important, now you might be looking for better cover in private hospitals. As Goode notes, too many people look backwards. When it comes to health insurance, you need to be looking ahead at all the \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios that could arise in the future to make sure you are adequately protected. Moreover, while you might be happy with a semi-private room in your thirties, \u201cyour appetite for risk will change as you get older, so you need to ensure your cover matches these requirements\u201d, he advises. According to Goode, you should expect to pay about \u20ac1,600 a year if you\u2019re looking for private room cover plus extra outpatient cover for those day-to-day expenses. Each of the insurers has a plan around this price bracket; VHI\u2019s PMI 48 10, for example, which costs \u20ac1,657 per adult; Laya\u2019s Optimum Premium (\u20ac1,670) and Irish Life\u2019s 4D Health 4 (\u20ac1,680). But again, you can expect shortfalls and exclusions, although Haigney notes that \u201cpeople are now more willing to accept there will be an excess\u201d. These policies will give you a private room in both a public and private hospital (the latter might be subject to an excess, such as \u20ac75 with VHI, as well as a shortfall of \u20ac50 per night). You\u2019ll also get cover (but maybe not in a private room) for the Beacon, Mater Private and Blackrock hospitals and, again, there might be an excess. With Laya, for example, you\u2019ll have a \u20ac175 shortfall per night in Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private. Be aware, however, that these policies won\u2019t always give full cover for certain orthopaedic procedures. With Irish Life, for example, you\u2019ll have to make a \u20ac2,000 co-payment. If you want to ensure better cover for orthopaedics, you might have to upgrade to a policy costing about \u20ac1,800. But not always. Laya\u2019s Simplicity plan (\u20ac1,535) has no excess or shortfall on five orthopaedic procedures, including hip and knee replacement. Outpatient cover tends to be decent at this price level, and you could expect about 75 per cent back on GP and consultant visits. Beyond that, however, it can make less sense to pay much more, unless you have particular needs. \u201cIf you\u2019re spending more than \u20ac1,800 per adult, you need a good reason to be doing that,\u201d says Goode. If you are looking for full cover across the hospital system, Haigney notes that you\u2019ll be looking at a plan such as VHI\u2019s Company Plan Executive (\u20ac3,474). However, even with such a plan you\u2019ll face a shortfall, of 20 per cent, on a private room in the high-tech hospitals. For full cover for a private room in such hospitals you\u2019ll need to consider a policy such as Laya\u2019s CompanyCare Advanced (\u20ac4,083).",

            "date": "2023-03-03",
            "raw_text": "Insurance providers have begun notifying customers of a potential shortfall in home cover due to a rise in the price of building materials, a scenario that has sparked an expected hike in premium costs. The increase in potential repair or replacement costs means many homeowners could find themselves \u201cunderinsured\u201d, meaning they would not be fully covered in the event of damage. Five months after the risk was first flagged by the Central Bank of Ireland, providers have written to customers. In one instance insurer RSA flagged average materials price increases of as much as 40 per cent. Policy holders are being asked to reassess their cover and, in an era of mounting cost-of-living pressures, upward re-evaluations mean higher premium charges. \u201cRisks of underinsurance on homes are typically being incurred where the insured value of the property is based on a developer\u2019s cost and has not been updated or where costs for outbuildings, driveways, gates, fences, paving or lighting have not been included,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Brokers Ireland, an umbrella body. [\u00a0 Many consumers not fully covered with home insurance, warns Central Bank \u00a0] RSA, just one of numerous insurers in the market, has written to customers encouraging them to ensure they are adequately covered. \u201cThe Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) has recently updated their guide on the rebuilding cost of homes, which shows an increase of 28 per cent on average since their last published rebuilding guide,\u201d it said. \u201cFor some regions/house types in Ireland the increases have been over 40 per cent.\u201d Will the protocol deal bring prosperity to Northern Ireland? Such figures, it explained, are a reflection of increases in building and labour costs as well as those \u201cassociated with the latest building regulations and specifications required\u201d. In late September the Central Bank reported that underinsurance in the home insurance market had increased from 6.5 per cent in 2017 to 16.5 per cent last year. A review it conducted also found \u201cnot all firms were sufficiently highlighting key risks\u201d to consumers, and said this must be addressed. [\u00a0 Insurance customers mistakenly believe loyalty is rewarded, study finds \u00a0] \u201cFirms must communicate with all home insurance customers setting out the consequences of being underinsured, the reasons why this is currently a heightened risk and how policyholders can better estimate an adequate \u2018sum insured\u2019 value,\u201d it said. The RSA letter included that criteria, pointing to one hypothetical example in which a house insured for a full rebuild cost of \u20ac400,000 was only covered for half of that sum. In such a case even a partial claim for \u20ac50,000 worth of repairs would only be covered to the value of \u20ac25,000. \u201cWhere your property is underinsured,\u201d it said, \u201cyou will not be fully protected against loss or damage and the value of any claim is reduced by whatever proportion is represented by the level of underinsurance.\u201d [\u00a0 Central Bank plans to ban \u2018loyalty penalties\u2019 across car and home insurance \u00a0] Jonathan Hehir of  Insuremyhouse.ie  said premiums had been rising for customers who had reassessed their cover but stressed the importance of doing so to safeguard against being underinsured. However, he said, the majority could offset increases simply by shopping around. \u201cIt\u2019s not just in the last six months that people have been caught [out] by underinsurance, this has been going on for a year now,\u201d he said, advising homeowners to consult estimated rebuilding costs calculated by the SCSI.",

            "raw_text": "Twelve insurance companies have been put on notice that they face High Court action from hundreds of restaurants and bars following Friday\u2019s landmark judgment against FBD Insurance. The High Court ruled that four pub owners are entitled to be compensated by FBD for the disruption their businesses suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The outcome affects claims made by about 1,100 pubs and restaurants. Following the ruling, solicitors acting for the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) wrote to insurance companies on behalf of 423 businesses seeking confirmation of indemnity and interim business interruption payments. The 12 insurance companies are: FBD, Hiscox Ireland, QBE Insurance Group, Specialist Underwriting Services, Allianz Ireland, Nationwide Broker Services, Contessa, Aviva, RSA Insurance, Citynet Insurance Brokers, AIG, and Lloyd\u2019s Insurances. RAI chief executive Adrian Cummins said the group's legal advisors had reviewed hundreds of policies on behalf of its members. \u201cWe have issued correspondence to 12 insurance companies on behalf of 423 companies giving them seven days notice to make interim payments or we will be going to the High Court for injunctive relief for our members who are initiating proceedings against them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have analysed about 600 policies and about two-thirds of those have, we believe, legitimate claims for businesses interruption.\u201d In the High Court decision, Mr Justice Denis McDonald found that a policy sold by FBD covered losses the pubs sustained by having to close due to the global health emergency. \u2018Valid\u2019 claims In a lengthy and detailed judgment delivered on Friday, the judge disagreed with FBD\u2019s interpretation of its policy. He said cover is not lost where the closure is prompted by nationwide outbreaks of disease provided there is an outbreak within the 25-mile radius and that outbreak is one of the causes of the closure. The issue of quantifying the losses, the judge said, will be dealt with at a later date. FBD said afterwards it would make interim payments on \u201cvalid\u201d business interruption claims under its pubs policy. The final cost for FBD may top \u20ac60 million, double what the insurer has set aside, according to analysts. However, the ultimate cost, including that borne by reinsurance companies that have taken on some of the risk, will be much higher. FBD has said it will not appeal the decision.",

            "raw_text": "The High Court has upheld a decision directing an insurance company to pay out over roof damage in a family home. In her ruling on Thursday, Ms Justice Siobh\u00e1n Phelan found there was \u201cample evidence\u201d to conclude the identified defect came within the insurance policy terms. Lloyd\u2019s Insurance Company SA had appealed a decision of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to uphold a complaint against it over its refusal to pay out on a couple\u2019s claim. The ombudsman had found it was unreasonable, unjust and improper for Lloyd\u2019s not to remediate the damage complained of and ordered the insurer to pay \u20ac20,000 to the couple as compensation for the inconvenience caused. The complainants\u2019 insurance policy, which was provided by the builder who sold them a house circa 2006, covered against structural defects in the property, the judge noted. About four years later, issues including pyrite-related damage and damage to the structure of the roof came to light. Lloyd\u2019s paid out over the pyrite but it did not accept the damage to the roof trusses was covered by the policy, the judge said. The cover refusal was based on the insurer\u2019s assertion that the trusses, which it accepted were structural, had been deflected due to the positioning of a water tank in the attic area which put pressure on them and led to cracking on ceilings and walls. Lloyd\u2019s maintained this constituted damage caused \u201cto\u201d the structure, rather than \u201cin\u201d the structure, which it said placed it beyond the policy remit. In appealing to the High Court, Lloyd\u2019s argued the ombudsman was guilty of serious and significant error in how it interpreted the word \u201cstructure\u201d in the policy. The ombudsman stood over its decision, saying the defect in the trusses, a load-bearing part of the roof, comes within the policy definition of structure. The roofing structure, it said, is intended to hold water tanks and should be designed and constructed to carry out that purpose. It further maintained that, in the alternative, were the complainants not entitled to a remedy as a matter of civil law deriving for the contract terms, the ombudsman\u2019s jurisdiction is wider that the High Court\u2019s and is not tied to the strict contractual rights. In their complaint to the ombudsman, the couple expressed significant discontent about the failure to deal with all the remediation at once, as they had to move out of their house for the pyrite works. High threshold Ms Justice Phelan noted the high threshold to be met for the High Court to set aside decisions of the ombudsman, whose jurisdiction derives from the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017. In this case, the court must be satisfied the ombudsman fell into \u201cserious and significant error\u201d in reaching its conclusions, she said, adding that she was not so satisfied here. There were conflicting opinions as to the cause of the damage to the tresses, she said. There was evidence it might not have occurred had the water tanks been correctly installed, but there was also evidence to support a conclusion that the trusses were not constructed so as to enable them to support a load without causing deflection, she added. It was her view that a reasonable person interpreting the contract would expect the roof trusses to have been designed and constructed in a way that rendered them fit to bear a water tank load \u201cor at least [. . .] the ombudsman was entitled to take this view\u201d. The judge took the view the ombudsman had erred in relying, in part, on a particular subsection of the 2017 Act, but she did not find this to be a fatal error. She found that the level of compensation ordered to the couple was within a reasonable range. Ms Justice Phelan affirmed the ombudsman\u2019s decision.",

            "raw_text": "Figures released on Thursday by the  Courts Service  indicate that the  changes introduced to personal injury award levels in April 2021  are having a marked effect on the number of claims being brought to court, and the awards being handed down when cases go all the way to judgment. The downward trend in award levels is likely to be reflected in the outcomes of cases that are settled without going to court, or that settle after litigation is filed but before the case reaches the point of the judge making a ruling. Because of the disruption caused by the  Covid  pandemic to court sittings, the Courts Service compared the 2022 data it published on Thursday to 2019. In terms of new personal injury cases lodged, there was a 43 per cent decline in new cases last year as compared with 2019. That is a substantial reduction by any measure. The value of the awards handed down last year by the Circuit Court, where there is a threshold of \u20ac60,000 in awards arising from personal injury actions, was only 58 per cent of those awarded by the court in 2019. The reduction, according to the Courts Service, highlights the changes brought about by the new award guidelines introduced by the Judicial Council, which were targeted at reducing awards for minor to moderate injuries. To date, there have been modest decreases in motor insurance, primarily due to increased competition... and nothing beyond the anecdotal in the areas of employer and public liability cover \u2014 Spokesman for the Alliance for Insurance Reform A spokesman for the Alliance for Insurance Reform, which represents not just business but also sporting organisations and others hit by high premiums, welcomed the latest data from the Courts Service, but compared it critically with what he said was a lack of movement on reducing premiums. \u201cSuch a substantial drop in the volume of claims and in awards should tie directly to a reduction in insurance premiums for motorists, businesses and sporting and community groups, and it is incumbent upon the Government to ensure that this is the case,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cTo date, there have been modest decreases in motor insurance, primarily due to increased competition (these reductions were of the order of 5-10 per cent and appear to have stalled) and nothing beyond the anecdotal in the areas of employer and public liability cover.\u201d \u2018No more excuses\u2019 The spokesman said the Government must use the \u201ccompelling\u201d new data to put pressure on the insurance companies. \u201cThere really are no more excuses for not passing on meaningful savings to policy holders.\u201d A spokeswoman for Insurance Ireland, which represents the insurance industry, said it was restricted from commenting on pricing matters for fear that it would be seen to be in breach of competition law. We see, day in, day out, persons with a variety of injuries having the indignity of being offended with totally inadequate awards for the pain, suffering and losses they have suffered \u2014 Jody Cantillion of Cantillion solicitors Jody Cantillon, a litigation partner with Cantillon solicitors in Cork, said the Judicial Council guidelines were working in so far as they were reducing award levels, but this was leading to increased profits for insurance companies rather than reduced premiums for consumers. [\u00a0 Judges can depart from personal injury guideline valuations, Supreme Court told \u00a0] The new award levels are inadequate, he said. \u201cWe see, day in, day out, persons with a variety of injuries having the indignity of being offended with totally inadequate awards for the pain, suffering and losses they have suffered. It is most unfortunate that there is no lobby to speak up for those injured.\u201d The agenda, he said, has been set by those who are responsible for the injuries, and he cited drunk drivers, irresponsible employers, insurers and the State. \u201cOne would have expected that some TDs might speak up for the injured persons. Sadly not.\u201d Senior counsel Eddie Walsh, who specialises in personal injuries litigation, said it was his experience that the new guidelines were contributing to a reluctance among plaintiffs to go to court. [\u00a0 Health insurance for your children: why waste the money? \u00a0] He said he was surprised more cases were not being heard in the Circuit Court and suspected some \u201cmiddle-class, respectable\u201d litigants who felt they were not properly compensated, were not going to court because they feared they would be perceived as \u201cmilking the system\u201d. Prescribing one amount for a particular injury did not work because a finger injury, for example, could have greater implications for a carpenter than someone else. \u201cIt is important that real injuries get real money,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped the ongoing review of the operation of the guidelines by the Judicial Council would take that into account.",

            "raw_text": "Industry group Brokers Ireland has welcomed the first conviction in Ireland of a \u201cghost broker\u201d, and has urged consumers to check the authenticity of any person or company selling or administering insurance policies. Ghost brokers are professional fraudsters selling forged or invalid discounted insurance policies to unsuspecting consumers. They usually advertise their services online or within local communities, typically claiming to be able to secure you a cheap motor insurance policy. Last week, Martin Hanudel was convicted at Trim Circuit Court after a Garda investigation revealed he was selling forged and invalid discounted insurance to people on Facebook. Industry body Brokers Ireland has welcomed the news, and warned members of the public to be alert to the practice. Cathie Shannon, director of general insurance at Brokers Ireland, said: \"Fraudsters often target young or what might be considered more vulnerable consumers, often foreign nationals who are not clear on how the insurance market works in Ireland and who may not have a good command of the English language.\" One of the most obvious signals that all is not right is a quote that \u201cseems too good to be true\u201d. \u201cIf it seems too good to be true it usually transpires that it is. This opens up the prospect of serious consequences when the unexpected or unwanted happens,\u201d Ms Shannon said.

            "raw_text": "The cost of health insurance for about two million consumers could jump by about 5 per cent in the months ahead with the two leading providers likely to follow Irish Life Health in rolling out price hikes, according to one of the State\u2019s leading health insurance analysts. Increases on that scale would see many individual policies rise by in excess of \u20ac70 but, coming on the back of similar price increases rolled out earlier this year, many policies will climb by in excess of \u20ac140 over the course of the year with some family policies increasing by over \u20ac400. While both the VHI and Laya Healthcare played down the prospect of a price increase this year, Dermot Goode from Total Health Cover said precedents suggested that when one provider increased its prices, \u201cthe others tend to move\u201d soon after that. [\u00a0 Health insurance: How to save up to \u20ac1,000 a year on your plan \u00a0] [\u00a0 Bank of Ireland and AIB expected to run rule over Laya Healthcare \u00a0] Mr Goode also noted that the reasons Irish Life Health gave for increasing its prices from the start of July were also impacting other providers. Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Anthony Boyle: \u2018My dad had to go to Gaelic training, and the same British soldier would throw his kit in a puddle every day\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 Irish in London: \u2018Nobody was making me stay. I could have left at any time and gone home to Sligo ... That was 24 years ago\u2019 The Irish Life increase, its second since the start of the year, will see some family policies climb by between \u20ac160 and \u20ac220 with the hikes affecting customers who renew their policies from July 1st. When it is added to the January increase, the annual cost of some family policies will climb by over \u20ac400. Irish Life Health said it was acting as a result of \u201ca very significant increase in the volume and size of claims\u201d adding that, post-pandemic, \u201cthere has been a considerable ramp-up in activity across all public and private health services, with private and hi-tech hospitals returning to full service and many much-needed procedures that had been deferred during the pandemic now taking place\u201d. It said the level of claims in 2022 from private and hi-tech hospitals had been \u201cthe highest seen since the inception of Irish Life Health in 2016\u2033 and pointed to \u201csubstantial medical and general inflation [which] has materialised over the last three years\u201d. Mr Goode said it would be prudent \u201cto assume the other insurance companies are feeling the exact same pressure and maybe more so because they have a greater share of the market\u201d. He said for Irish Life Health to increase its prices twice in seven months with all the negative attention such a move brought was an indication of the \u201cserious claims coming through\u201d. And he added that while he had anticipated a price increase from all companies towards the end of the year there was \u201cnow a real possibility that they might move sooner\u201d. However, when contacted, the VHI said that it \u201ccurrently has no plans for a price increase\u201d. Laya Healthcare said it had no plans to increase its prices but a company spokeswoman told The Irish Times that it would continue to \u201cclosely monitor healthcare costs and trends\u201d. She added that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve no plans for another price review this year, we will continue to keep these cost pressures under close review and take a prudent view on claim cost management on behalf of our members\u201d.",
